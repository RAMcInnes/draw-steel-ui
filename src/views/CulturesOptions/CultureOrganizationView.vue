    <h1>Organization</h1>
    <p>
        Your culture’s organization aspect determines the
        functioning and leadership of your community. You might
        come from a place with an officially recognized government
        and a system of laws. Or your culture might have enjoyed a
        less formal organization, with the people in charge having
        naturally gravitated toward their positions without any
        official offices or oaths.
        <br>
        When you build a culture, select its organization aspect
        from the following options: anarchic, bureaucratic, or
        communal. You then gain skill options from your chosen
        system of organization.

                Anarchic
            </v-expansion-panel-title>
            <v-expansion-panel-text>
                In an anarchic culture, there are no rules and no one person
                leads the others. This might sound like complete chaos—
                people taking what they want when they want it—and
                some cultures that practice anarchy are. Other anarchic
                cultures are peaceful places where people mostly work for
                themselves, their friends, or their family, but rely on the
                whole group when times get tough.
                <br>
                Many anarchic cultures come together when the need
                arises, but they leave day-to-day responsibilities up to the
                individual. If an informal leader appears, it’s because each
                member of the culture has decided to follow that person for
                a time, and the leader enjoys their power only as long as
                they keep everyone happy. A group of rangers who protect
                a vast forest, a gang of rebels fighting against a tyrannical
                despot leader, and a bandit group roving the wilds without
                a leader are all anarchic cultures.
                <br>
                Most anarchic cultures operate outside of settled lands,
                sticking to the wilds, city sewers, or other secret places. For
                even when such cultures are harmless, their members
                know that outsiders might try to impose rules upon them if
                they live in the same place. As such, many folks in anarchic
                cultures learn how to navigate the wilds and fend for
                themselves while avoiding the danger that other folks can
                represent.

                Bureaucratic
            </v-expansion-panel-title>
            <v-expansion-panel-text>
                Bureaucratic cultures are steeped in official leadership and
                formally recorded laws. Members of such a culture are
                often ranked in power according to those laws, with a small
                group of people holding the power to rule according to
                birthright, popular vote, or some other official and
                measurable standard. Many bureaucratic communities
                have one person at the very top, though others might be
                ruled by a council. A trade guild with a guildmaster,
                treasurer, secretary, and a charter of rules and regulations
                for membership; a feudal lord who rules over a group of
                knights, who in turn rule over peasants who work the land;
                and a militaristic society with ranks and rules that its
                people must abide are all examples of bureaucratic cultures.
                <br>
                Those who thrive in bureaucratic cultures don’t just follow
                the rules. They know how to use those rules to their
                advantage, either bending, changing, or reinterpreting
                policy to advance their own interests. Schmoozing with
                those who make the laws is often key to this approach.
                Others in a bureaucratic culture might specialize in
                operating outside the strict regulations that govern the
                culture without getting caught.

                Communal
            </v-expansion-panel-title>
            <v-expansion-panel-text>
                A communal culture is a place where all members of the
                collective are considered equal. The community works
                together to make important decisions that affect the
                majority of the culture. While they elect leaders to carry out
                these decisions and organize their efforts, each person has
                a relatively equal say in how the culture operates, and
                everyone contributes to help their people survive and
                thrive. Individuals often share the burdens of governing,
                physical labor, childcare, and other duties. A collective of
                farmers who work together to cultivate and protect their
                land without a noble, a city of pirates where each person
                can do as they wish, and a traveling theatrical troupe whose
                members vote on every artistic and administrative decision
                are all communal cultures.
                <br>
                People in communal cultures learn that their voice and
                individuality has worth, as do the opinions and hard work
                of others.
