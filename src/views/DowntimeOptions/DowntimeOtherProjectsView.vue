        Not all heroes want to craft or research during their time
        between adventures. Some wish to build organizations,
        reconnect with family, or just simply go fishing.

                When you begin this project, you must be in a settlement
                or other place where people gather, and you must be in
                that place each time you make a project roll for the project.
                You can undertake several Community Service projects,
                each one in a different community.
                <br>
                While undertaking this project, you provide help to people
                in need, doing odd jobs, tutoring life skills, cleaning statues,
                finding lost valuables, or the like. The Director determines
                the characteristic that applies to the project roll based on
                the activities you undertake. When you complete this
                project, you receive a random consumable of the
                Director’s choice as thanks for your hard work.

                Fishing
            </v-expansion-panel-title>
            <v-expansion-panel-text>
                You’ve gone fishing, provided you are near a body of water.
                The project roll for this project has the following changes:
                <br>
                <br>• The points you roll represent the length of the fish (or
                fish-like creature) you catch.
                <br>• During each respite when you undertake this activity,
                you continue making project rolls until you get an 11 or
                lower (fish got away, earning you no points) or a
                breakthrough.
                <br>• A breakthrough results in rolling on the fishing events
                table instead of additional points or another project roll.
                <br><br>
                When you finish rolling, you can spend the points you
                earned on a reward from the Tackle table. Any points you
                don’t spend during this respite activity are lost.

            <v-expansion-panel-text>
                You revitalize your spirit by spending time with people
                you love who you haven’t seen in a long while. You must
                be able to communicate with them in order to undertake
                this project and make project rolls for it. When you
                complete this project, your Stamina maximum increases
                by 12 + your level until the end of your next respite. You
                can’t start another Spend Time with Loved Ones project
                for 1 month.
