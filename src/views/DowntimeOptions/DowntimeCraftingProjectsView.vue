    <h1>Crafting Projects</h1>
    <p>
        Crafting projects enable heroes to create vehicles, magic
        items, and more. When you begin a crafting project, other
        creatures can also work on the project, using their respite
        activity to contribute a project roll to it in order to get the
        work done faster. Unless a project has a complication table
        of its own, research projects use the Crafting and Research
        Events Prompts table for event prompts.

                Build Airship
            </v-expansion-panel-title>
            <v-expansion-panel-text>
                When you begin this project, you hire a crew of carpenters,
                mages, and shipwrights who work in the area where the
                project begins, with these artisans building the ship for
                you. You can make a project roll whenever you are
                overseeing the project, which you might be able to do
                remotely through the use of magic or psionics.
                When the project is completed, you have an airship. You
                and any creatures you designate can operate the ship by
                touching the wheel. During combat, a creature touching
                the wheel of the ship can use a maneuver to make the ship
                move up to 10 squares. The ship can be moved only once
                per round. Out of combat, the ship has a speed of 130
                miles per day.
                An airship is an object (giving it immunity all to poison
                and psychic damage), and can take 200 damage before it is
                destroyed. If the damage the ship takes is not too severe
                (as the Director determines), as long as you have access to
                materials that can repair the ship, you can restore it back
                to its original condition as a respite activity.

                Build Or Repair Road
            </v-expansion-panel-title>
            <v-expansion-panel-text>
                When you begin this project, you hire a crew of masons,
                engineers, and guards who work in the starting location
                where the project began and build or repair the road for
                you. You can make a project roll whenever you are
                overseeing the project, which you may be able to do
                remotely through the use of magic or psionics, provided
                you have the means.
                <br>
                The project points required to complete work on the road
                equals 10 × the road’s length in miles. The goal is cut in
                half if you are repairing an existing road, or someone else
                begins work on a second road project starting from the
                second location connecting to your first location.
                <br>
                When you complete the project, you earn Renown with the
                people depending on the length of the road. Time spent
                traveling on the road is cut in half. Access to resources and
                knowledge is improved in both locations, giving you and
                your allies an edge on project rolls to discover lore while
                you are in the area.

                Craft Teleportation Platform
            </v-expansion-panel-title>
            <v-expansion-panel-text>
                When you complete this project, you end up with a 3 x 3
                square teleportation platform with a magic password. The
                platform is permanently affixed to the ground where you
                create it. You can use the teleportation platform to
                instantly teleport any creatures or objects on the platform
                to a location or another teleportation platform with a
                magic password you know. Each time the teleportation
                platform is used, the chance of it malfunctioning and
                teleporting its contents to a random platform increases by
                1% (to a maximum of 50%). When you have access to the
                platform, you can restore it back to its original condition
                as a respite activity.

            <v-expansion-panel-text>
                You can craft the items found in Treasures (See <i>Treasures</i>).
                Each item notes its prerequisites, project source, project roll
                characteristic, and project goal.

                Find a Cure
            </v-expansion-panel-title>
            <v-expansion-panel-text>
                You research a cure for a disease, curse, or supernatural
                affliction that references this project as a way to end it. If
                the affliction was caused by another creature, you need
                the remains of that creature or another creature of the
                same kind as an item prerequisite for making the cure. For
                example, you can research the cure for the affliction of a
                werewolf’s Accursed Bite by studying the corpse of any
                werewolf, not just the one who did the biting. The number
                of project points it takes to complete this project is equal
                to the creature’s level times 50.
                <br>
                If the affliction is created by something other than a
                creature, such as an environmental effect, than the effect
                lists the item prerequisite and project points required to
                complete this project.
                <br>
                When you complete this project, you craft one dose of an
                alchemical cure for that affliction. Once the project is
                completed, you can craft subsequent doses for the same
                affliction in half the number of project points the initial
                project took.

                Imbue Treasure
            </v-expansion-panel-title>
            <v-expansion-panel-text>
                You can create leveled treasures by imbuing items with
                magic or psionic power. You must have a mundane version
                of the item you plan to imbue, such as a sword or shield,
                when you begin this project.
                <br>
                You can imbue any item three times. The first time you
                imbue it, you pick a 1st-level enhancement. The second
                time you imbue it, you pick a 5th-level enhancement. The
                third time you imbue it, you pick a 9th-level enhancement.
                A hero using armor, an implement, or a weapon can’t
                benefit from an enhancement unless they are using a kit
                that includes the armor, implement, or weapon type, and
                their level matches the enhancement’s level.
                <br>
                If an enhancement has a Roman numeral greater than I
                after it, such as the Phasing III enhancement, that
                enhancement can’t be applied unless the item has all
                previous versions of the enhancement. This means you
                can’t imbue armor with the Phasing III enhancement
                unless it has the Phasing I and Phasing II enhancements
                first. These numbered enhancements are cumulative
                unless otherwise noted.
                <br>
                Enhancements are listed by item type and level. Each item
                type and level features a table showing the name, item
                prerequisites, and project source language of each
                enhancement. Imbued items take the Magic or Psionic
                keyword (your choice), plus any keywords appropriate to
                the type of item (Light Armor, Implement, Medium
                Weapon, and so forth).
                <br>
                Imbuing magical treasure as a project typically means you
                undertake that project to make use of the treasure
                yourself. As such, all the features of imbuing make
                reference to “you” as the user of the item. However,
                imbued items can be created for other creatures, or
                created by other creatures and found as treasure.
