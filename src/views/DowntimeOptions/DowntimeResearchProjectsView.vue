    <h1>Research Projects</h1>
    <p class="mx-3">
        Heroes can undertake the following research projects,
        which require the study of documents, spycraft, or
        interviewing experts. Unless a project has a complication
        table or entry of its own, research projects use the Crafting
        and Research Events Prompts table for event prompts.

                Discover Lore
            </v-expansion-panel-title>
            <v-expansion-panel-text>
                If you want to track the location of a lost treasure,
                decipher a ritual, or trace the lineage of a royal family to
                find the next heir to the throne, you can start a project to
                delve into whatever mysteries you seek to unravel. You
                might start a project to discover lore because the
                information can’t be discovered through a regular test, or
                you could do so because you failed a test to recall
                information and now want to learn it through research.
                <br><br>
                When you start a project to discover lore, you choose the
                lore you want investigated and the questions you want
                answered. The Director tells you if the lore you seek
                amounts to common, obscure, lost, or forbidden
                knowledge. The more esoteric the knowledge, the more
                project points are required to find the answers you seek.
                <br><br>
                When you begin a Discover Lore project, other creatures
                can also work on the project, using their respite activity to
                contribute a project roll to it in order to get the work done
                faster.

                Go Undercover
            </v-expansion-panel-title>
            <v-expansion-panel-text>
                Going undercover to spy on a group of people is a cheap
                and easy way to find what you’re looking for. Choose an
                organization when you undertake this activity. Completing
                this project grants you access to maps, knowledge about
                an organization’s operations, or some other piece of
                knowledge that would be considered common or obscure
                (see the Discover Lore project). At the Director’s
                discretion, you must have a disguise, signet ring, tattoo, or
                some other indication that you belong to the organization
                in order to begin this project. Additionally, the Director
                can decide that the knowledge you seek may not be gained
                through this project but rather through adventuring.
                <br><br>
                <b>Complications:</b> This project has its own special
                complications. The first time you complete this project
                within an organization, you have a 25% chance of being
                caught. Each time you complete this project with the same
                organization, the chance of you being caught the next time
                you use it within the same organization increases by 25%
                and the project goal increases by 30. If you are caught
                going undercover, you are ruthlessly pursued by the
                organization you were infiltrating.
                <br><br>
                While your secret is safe, you may be called upon by the
                organization to complete a task you may not want to do.
                Failure to complete the task leads to you being caught.

                Hone Career Skills
            </v-expansion-panel-title>
            <v-expansion-panel-text>
                You revisit your previous life and freshen up on the
                experience it provided you. When the project is complete,
                you have an edge on tests made with the skills provided by
                your career.

                Learn From A Master
            </v-expansion-panel-title>
            <v-expansion-panel-text>
                When you start a project with a master, you choose the
                goal you wish to work on as well as the benefit you would
                gain from it. The Director tells you if it is within the
                master’s ability to teach you what you’re looking for.
                Alternatively, you may stumble upon the left behind
                teachings of a master, and learning from them may fit into
                one of the following goals.

                Learn A New Language
            </v-expansion-panel-title>
            <v-expansion-panel-text>
                When you start this project, choose a language taught by
                the project source. When the project is complete, you
                understand the language.

                Learn New Recipe
            </v-expansion-panel-title>
            <v-expansion-panel-text>
                You practice being able to reliably follow a recipe for a
                dish. The ingredients required depend on the recipe being
                followed, which may be easier or harder to acquire based
                on the degrees of separation you have from the recipe’s
                origin. When you complete this project, you can make 5
                servings of the specific recipe as a respite activity
                whenever you have access to the ingredients. You and
                each creature taking a respite with you can a serving and
                gain its benefits until they take another respite. A creature
                can only benefit from one recipe at a time and can’t benefit
                from more than one serving of a recipe at a time.
