    <h1>Downtime Project Overview</h1>
    <p>
        As a team, you and your fellow heroes can achieve great
        things. But the time between adventures gives you a
        chance to pursue your own goals: uncover forbidden lore
        in ancient tomes, forge weapons of great power, build
        ships that can sail the skies, and more. Draw Steel’s project
        rules allow heroes to use their time during respites to
        obtain important information, make new equipment and
        strongholds, and engage in other activities to support their
        adventuring.

            Tracking Projects
        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            You start a project during a respite. You can start as many
            projects as you like, but you can’t work on more than one
            project at a time during a respite. Eventually, you’ll be able
            to hire creatures who can work on additional projects for
            you.
            <br>
            You can track project progress on your character sheet. As
            you work on a project, you might look over old books that
            you’ve found in your travels, perform experiments,
            converse with experts and scholars, or work with tools to
            create something.

            Project Prerequisites
        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            All projects have prerequisites you must meet before you
            can start them.
            <br><br>
            <h3>Item Prerequisites</h3>
            <p>
                Many projects have special items you must possess or
                obtain before you can begin the project. For instance, you
                can’t build an airship without first finding a Wind Crystal
                of Quintessence, a rare and key component in that
                vehicle’s construction. Other projects have prerequisites
                that involve undertaking certain actions during the project
                process
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Project Source</h3>
            <p>
                To start a project, you must have access to specific lore
                detailing how the project is to be undertaken. This can be
                in the form of written information (a book, scroll,
                schematic, and so forth), an expert tutor with wisdom to
                share, a master artisan with skills to teach, a magical
                manifestation of the project’s scope and secrets, or any
                other form of the Director’s determination. This project focused lore is referred to as a project source. Not only do
                you need project sources to start a project, you must have
                access to them whenever you make a project roll for that
                particular project (see Project Roll).
                <br>
                Some project sources can be relatively easy to find.
                Building a castle doesn’t require tomes filled with ancient
                lore, but it’s also not something every stonemason knows
                how to do. However, the location of the tomb of Ashrya,
                the mummified protector of one hundred slumbering
                sorcerer-sovereigns, might exist only in a single tome that
                requires an accompanying adventure to unearth.
                <br>
                The language with which project sources are set down or
                can be shared is chosen by the Director. The sample
                projects below have suggestions, though you might be able
                to find a version of a source in other languages as well.
                <br>
                Whenever the Director determines that a creature with
                needed knowledge can be used as a project source,
                another hero can serve as this source of knowledge.
                However, they must use a respite activity to be your
                project source whenever you make a project roll related to
                the project.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>SEARCH FOR COMMON PROJECT SOURCES</h4>
            <p>
                If you need a project source for a particular project, ask
                your Director if the source is common enough that it might
                be found in a substantial library, among a group of sages
                or guild artisans, and so forth. If the Director says yes, then
                the next time you take a respite in a place with a library or
                access to creatures with the knowledge you seek, you can
                locate the project source you need as a respite activity.
