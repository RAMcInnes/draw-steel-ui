    <h1>Criminal</h1>
    <p>
        You once worked as a bandit, insurgent, smuggler, outlaw,
        or even as an assassin. In defining your career, think about
        the following questions:
        <br>• What sorts of crimes did you commit, and why?
        <br>• Did anyone help you perform your illicit activities?
        <br>• What is one crime you botched?
        <br>• Who was your nemesis while you were a criminal?
    </p>
