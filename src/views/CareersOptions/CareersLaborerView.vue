    <h1>Laborer</h1>
    <p>
        You worked as a farmer, builder, clothes washer, forester,
        miner, or some other profession engaged in hard manual
        labor. In defining your career, think about the following
        questions:
        <br>• What type of manual labor did you do?
        <br>• What important friendship did you make on the job?
        <br>• Where did you go with your coworkers to blow off
        steam when the job was done?
        <br>• What aspect of the job was most difficult for you?
    </p>
