    <h1>Farmer</h1>
    <p>
        You grew crops or cared for livestock. In defining your
        career, think about the following questions:
        <br>• Did you own the land you farmed, or did you farm for
        another?
        <br>• What crops or livestock did you cultivate?
        <br>• Who else worked on the farm with you?
        <br>• What ill omen did you witness that caused you to have a
        poor season of farming?
    </p>
