    <h1>Beggar</h1>
    <p>
        You lived by going to a tavern, crossroads, city street, or
        other busy area and begging passersby for money or food.
        In defining your career, think about the following
        questions:
        <br>• What unfortunate circumstances led you to become a
        beggar?
        <br>• Where did you beg?
        <br>• Who made sport out of bullying you?
        <br>• Who showed you the most kindness?
    </p>
