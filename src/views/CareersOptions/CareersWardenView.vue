    <h1>Warden</h1>
    <p>
        You protected a wild region from those who sought to
        harm it, such as poachers and cultists bent on the
        destruction of the natural world. Knowing your land well,
        you could also serve as a guide or the leader of a rescue
        party for those wandering the wilds. In defining your
        career, think about the following questions:
        <br>• What environment did you protect?
        <br>• Were you part of a formal group of wardens or did you
        take the job upon yourself?
        <br>• Which animal became your constant companion while
        you worked in the wild?
        <br>• What mysterious creature or wanderer did you meet in
        the forest, and what prophecy did they share with you?
    </p>
