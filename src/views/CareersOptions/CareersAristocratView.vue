        Career? Who needs a career when you’re born into money!
        Or marry into it! Or con your way into it! Whatever the
        case, you didn’t need to work thanks to (someone’s)
        generational wealth. In defining your career, think about
        the following questions:
        <br>• How did you become an aristocrat?
        <br>• What did you do to fill your days?
        <br>• Which aristocrats and people who worked for you were
        your best friends and greatest enemies?
        <br>• What sentimental heirloom from your old estate do you
        carry, and what does it mean to you?
