    <h1>Career Overview</h1>
    <p>
        Being a hero isn’t a job. It’s a calling. But before you
        answered that call, you had a different job or vocation that
        paid the bills. Thank the gods for that, because the
        experience you gained in that career is now helping you
        save lives and slay monsters.

            Career Questions
        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            The careers in this section don’t go into great detail about
            the actual jobs they represent. We assume that you know
            the basics of what an artisan, a criminal, or a gladiator
            does for a living. However, each career includes a list of
            questions you should think about to help you define the
            specific details of your hero’s career. For instance, if you
            pick the Artisan career, one of the questions is “What did
            you create?” You don’t need to answer these questions, but
            doing so can help shape a more complete picture of your
            hero.
            <br>
            If you answer any of these questions, consider telling your
            Director the answers. It can help them work some
            dramatic moments into the game. Maybe not! Directors
            already have a lot to juggle, but they certainly won’t work
            your backstory into the plot if you never tell them.

                    different skill.

                <v-expansion-panel-text>
                    Some careers provide project points you can put toward
                    crafting and research projects (see <b>Downtime Projects</b>).
                    <br>
                    These points can be divided among multiple projects, but
                    they can’t be used more than once. At the Director’s
                    discretion, your career might also let you start the game
                    with the materials needed for one or more projects, so you
                    can immediately put your project points toward them,
                    possibly before the adventure begins!

            Inciting Incident
        </v-card-title>
        <p>
            Each career has a list of inciting incidents, each of which
            suggests a potential reason why you gave up your career,
            turned away from a possibly comfortable and reliable
            living, and took up the sword (or axe or wand) to become
            an adventuring hero. Each inciting incident represents a
            life-changing event that might have motivated you to
            change course, becoming a person who risks it all to save
            others.
            <br>
            You can roll for or choose an inciting incident from the
            table that accompanies each career. You can also use the
            table as inspiration and work with your Director to come
            up with a unique inciting incident of your own
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>What Was Taken From You?</h3>
        <p>
            During your inciting incident, something was taken from
            you. It might have been a material object, such as an
            heirloom sword or a locket that proves your royal heritage.
            Perhaps a person you loved was killed, kidnapped, or
            cursed. It might be something deeper and more abstract,
            such as a chance for happiness, belief in the future, belief
            in basic goodness, or a lifetime goal snatched away.
            <br>
            It might be the case that you’re obsessed with getting back
            what you lost. You might be in a position where you’ll
            never recover what was taken from you, but you want to
            prevent that same loss from happening to others. Maybe
            you’ve become an itinerant hero because, after your loss,
            it’s the only thing that gives your life meaning. Maybe all of
            the above. Whatever the case, the loss you’ve suffered is
            part of what drives you to be a hero. Record what was
            taken from you on your character sheet, and let your
            Director know.
