    <h1>Performer</h1>
    <p>
        You can sing, act, or dance well enough that people
        actually pay to see you do it. Imagine that! In defining your
        career, think about the following questions:
        <br>• What is the tone of your performances?
        <br>• What song, role, or dance are you most known for?
        <br>• Did you perform in the same place throughout your
        career, or did you travel?
        <br>• Were you part of a troupe, or were you a solo act?
    </p>
