    <h1>Sage</h1>
    <p>
        From an early age, you dedicated yourself to learning,
        whether you shared the knowledge of the world with
        others or sought out secret lore only for yourself. In
        defining your career, think about the following questions:
        <br>• What subjects did you study?
        <br>• Where did your studies take place?
        <br>• How did you acquire the books and other materials you
        needed for work?
        <br>• Who benefited most from your research?
    </p>
