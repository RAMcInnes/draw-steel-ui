    <h1>Disciple</h1>
    <p>
        You worked in a church, temple, or other religious
        institution as part of the clergy. In defining your career,
        think about the following questions:
        <br>• What gods or saints did your institution venerate?
        <br>• What initiation rites did you undergo to get the job?
        <br>• What were your responsibilities as a disciple?
        <br>• How was your institution viewed by members of the
        local culture?
