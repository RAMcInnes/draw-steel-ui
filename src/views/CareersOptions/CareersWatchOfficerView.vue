    <h1>Watch Office</h1>
    <p>
        You served as an officer of the law for a local government.
        You might have been a single person in a much larger city
        watch or the only constable patrolling a small village. In
        defining your career, think about the following questions:
        <br>• What type of settlement did you protect?
        <br>• What was your law enforcement style like? Were you a
        by-the-book officer, a more lenient-but-fair type, or
        totally corrupt?
        <br>• What criminal still eludes your grasp to this day?
        <br>• Whose life did you save in the line of duty?
        <br>• What is the most absurd call you ever responded to and
        how did you handle it?
