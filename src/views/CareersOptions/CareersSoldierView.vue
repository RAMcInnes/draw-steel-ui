    <p>
        In your formative years, you fought tirelessly in
        skirmishes and campaigns against enemy forces. In
        defining your career, think about the following questions:
        <br>• In which army and company did you serve?
        <br>• What conflicts were you a part of?
        <br>• What rank did you achieve?
        <br>• What heroics did you perform in the heat of battle?
    </p>
