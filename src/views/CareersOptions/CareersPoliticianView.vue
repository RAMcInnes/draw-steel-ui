    <h1>Politician</h1>
    <p>
        You worked as a leader within a formal, bureaucratic
        organization or government. You might have been
        appointed, born, or elected into your position, but getting
        people to agree and making decisions for the people you
        serve (or who served you) was your job. In defining your
        career, think about the following questions:
        <br>• Who were you responsible for ruling or representing?
        <br>• What was your official title and how did you earn it?
        <br>• Who was your greatest political rival?
        <br>• What secret do you know that could tear apart the
        entire system you worked within?
    </p>
