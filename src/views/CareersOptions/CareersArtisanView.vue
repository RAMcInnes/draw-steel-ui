    <p>
        You made and sold useful wares. In defining your career,
        think about the following questions:
        <br>• What did you create?
        <br>• Who taught you your craft?
        <br>• Was there any particular creation you were known for?
        <br>• Did you have a shop, or did you travel to sell your
        wares?
    </p>
