    <h1>Explorer</h1>
    <p>
        You ventured into uncharted areas and made your living
        as a cartographer, researcher, resource seeker, or treasure
        hunter. In defining your career, think about the following
        questions:
        <br>• For what purpose did you explore the unknown?
        <br>• Who else was part of your exploration team?
        <br>• What types of environments did you explore?
        <br>• What legend or rumor did you search for but never
        found?
        <br>• What is your greatest discovery?
    </p>
