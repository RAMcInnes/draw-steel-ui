        For long years, you studied magic under the mentorship of
        a more experienced mage. In defining your career, think
        about the following questions:
        <br>• Who did you study under, and what kind of person were
        they?
        <br>• What were your mentor’s areas of expertise?
        <br>• What aspects of magic did you struggle to comprehend?
        <br>• What is your current relationship with your mentor?
