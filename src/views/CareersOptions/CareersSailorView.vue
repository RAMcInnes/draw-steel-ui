    <h1>Sailor</h1>
    <p>
        You worked on a ship that might have been a merchant
        cog, a mercenary or military craft, or a pirate vessel. You
        might have been a deckhand, a mate, or even the captain.
        In defining your career, think about the following
        questions:
        <br>• What is the name of the vessel you sailed on and what
        type of business was the crew engaged in?
        <br>• What was your job aboard the boat?
        <br>• What’s the longest amount of time you’ve spent at sea?
        <br>• Who or what did you lose on your maritime journeys?
    </p>
