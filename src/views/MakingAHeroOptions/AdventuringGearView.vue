    <h1>Adventuring Gear</h1>
    <p>
        This isn’t a game about tracking gear, so you don’t need to
        list every piece of equipment you own on your character
        sheet. The game assumes that heroes generally have
        enough to eat and drink, so the rules don’t expect you to
        track food and water either.
        <br>
        If your character has a skill that implicitly requires gear,
        such as lockpicks for the Pick Lock skill or basic alchemy
        supplies for use with the Alchemy skill, then you have that
        gear. Likewise, your character is assumed to have
        standard useful adventuring gear, including a torch, a rope,
        and a backpack at minimum.
        <br>
        At the Director’s discretion, you might lose certain gear
        during an adventure, or your gear could break. If this
        happens, you might not be able to perform certain tasks as
        effectively without that gear.
