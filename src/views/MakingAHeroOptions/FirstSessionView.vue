    <h1>Your First Session</h1>
    <p class="mx-3">
        Getting together with your friends to make characters can
        be a lot of fun. Many groups spend most of their first
        session talking about the campaign’s story, making heroes,
        and going over expectations for the game. It’s a great way
        to kick off a long-term campaign.

            The Director should make an agenda for a campaign’s first
            session—often called “session zero”—which can include
            any of the following items:
            <br>
            <br>• The Director and players talk about the safety tools they
            want to employ at the game table (whether physical or
            virtual), so that everyone has a good time and
            understands which topics should be avoided in the
            game’s narrative and which should be embraced. For
            more information, check out the MCDM Tabletop Safety
            Toolkit at mcdm.gg/SafetyToolkit, which includes
            advice for running a successful session zero.
            <br>• The Director discusses the campaign’s world and the
            major story themes they want to introduce into the
            game.
            <br>• The Director should tell the players if there are any
            options that are limited or rare in their campaign. For
            example, some Director’s don’t want psionics to make
            an appearance in their game worlds, so they might
            decide that heroes can’t be nulls or talents. Another
            campaign might be grounded in more typical medieval
            fantasy and not have any memonek or time raiders, or
            those ancestries might be exceedingly rare, leading
            heroes with those ancestries to get a lot of questions
            from curious NPCs.
            <br>• The players get a chance to tell the Director what they
            would like to see in the campaign. This can include
            anything from “I’d love to play out some chase scenes!”
            to “I want to explore themes of loss and grief.” These
            wishes should be starting points for a conversation. If
            not all players are comfortable with certain themes or
            content requested by other players, then session zero is
            a great time to discuss that and come to a consensus
            about what everyone wants out of the game.
            <br>• Make heroes! Once everyone understands what the
            campaign is about, it’s the perfect time to get into
            character creation. When a group of players make
            heroes together, they can tie backstories together and
            strategize to build a tactically dominant party both in
            and out of combat.
            <br>• The Director runs an encounter to kick off the campaign.
            If all the players have the time, it’s totally worth it to get
            some play in during the first session, even if it’s just a
            quick brawl in a tavern with some cultists! Giving the
            players a little action lets them see what the game is all
            about—and leaves them excited for the next session.
