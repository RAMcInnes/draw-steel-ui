    <h1>Step-By-Step Hero Making</h1>
    <p class="mx-3">
        Use the following step-by-step guide to create a hero.
        These steps are presented in what we believe is the best
        way to approach making your first hero for Draw Steel.
        That said, the order of the steps is still a suggestion, not a
        hard and fast rule.
        <br><br>
        Many players like to build a hero from the backstory up,
        making ancestry and culture ideal first choices. However,
        some players like to start more in the present, choosing an
        inciting incident and a class—the choices with the most
        potential impact on what your character can do in the
        game—and then going back and figuring out where their
        hero came from. There’s no wrong way to do it!
        You’ll want a character sheet to fill out while you make
        your hero.
        <br><br>
        Each option you can select for your hero at 1st level
        includes a parenthetical option labeled “Quick Build.” This
        is for players who want to build a hero faster without
        reading over all the options. These selections represent
        the most straightforward and archetypical options you can
        pick while building a hero. Most quick build options don’t
        select languages for you, because your Director knows
        better than us which languages will be most useful in your
        campaign.

                    1. Think
                </v-expansion-panel-title>
                <v-expansion-panel-text>
                    The first thing you should do is think about the kind of
                    hero you want to make. Ask yourself the following
                    questions:
                    <br>
                    <br>• Do you fight with weapons, magic, psionics, or some
                    combination of these abilities?
                    <br>• Outside of combat, what do you want your hero to do
                    well?
                    <br>• What did you do before becoming a hero?
                    <br>• Why did you choose to become a hero?
                    <br>• What is your personality like?
                    <br>• What people, places, and objects are important to you?
                    <br>• How will your hero complement the strengths and
                    weaknesses of the other heroes?
                </v-expansion-panel-text>

            <v-expansion-panel>
                <v-expansion-panel-title>
                    2. Ancestry
                </v-expansion-panel-title>
                <v-expansion-panel-text>
                    Choose your hero’s humanoid ancestry from among the
                    range of ancestries available in the game—devil, dragon
                    knight, dwarf, hakaan, high elf, human, memonek, orc,
                    polder, revenant, time raider, or wode elf. Future
                    supplements will introduce additional ancestries you can
                    choose from.
                    <br><br>
                    See <b>Ancestries</b> for more information.

                <v-expansion-panel-title>
                    3. Culture
                </v-expansion-panel-title>
                <v-expansion-panel-text>
                    Create your hero’s culture. Although ancestry gives your
                    hero a number of physiological benefits, your culture
                    describes the community that raised you and gives you
                    languages and skills. 
                    <br><br>
                    See <b>Culture</b> for more information.

                <v-expansion-panel-title>
                    4. Career
                </v-expansion-panel-title>
                <v-expansion-panel-text>
                    Choose your hero’s career, which describes what you did
                    for a living before you became a hero. Your career gives
                    you skills and a title, and might also give you languages,
                    Renown, or knowledge for crafting and research.
                    <br><br>
                    See <b>Careers</b> for more information.

                <v-expansion-panel-title>
                    5. Class
                </v-expansion-panel-title>
                <v-expansion-panel-text>
                    Choose your hero’s class. This choice has the biggest
                    impact on how your hero interacts with the rules of the
                    game, especially the rules for combat. Your class provides
                    your characteristic scores and Stamina, in addition to
                    skills, several abilities, and other benefits. You can be a
                    censor, conduit, elementalist, fury, null, shadow, tactician,
                    talent, or troubadour.

                <v-expansion-panel-title>
                  6. Kit
                </v-expansion-panel-title>
                <v-expansion-panel-text>
                    If your class gives your hero a kit, choose your hero’s kit.
                    Your kit provides you with equipment and a fighting style
                    that grants a signature ability and bonuses to one or more
                    of your game statistics.
                    <br><br>
                    See <b>Kits</b> for more information.

                <v-expansion-panel-title>
                  7. Add Free Strikes
                </v-expansion-panel-title>
                <v-expansion-panel-text>
                    The simplest and most basic attack you can make, typically
                    worse than every other option, free strike abilities are
                    those strikes you can make when it’s not your turn. An
                    enemy is foolish enough to walk away from you in melee?
                    Free strike! Every hero has both a melee and ranged
                    weapon free strike, they’re all the same (until modified by
                    your kit or class) and it’s up to you to decide what exactly
                    these strikes are. A thrown dagger? A punch? The design is
                    intended to let you use your imagination.
                    <br><br>
                    Free strikes also let you make strikes on your turn even if
                    your hero isn’t otherwise themed to do so. A bow-using
                    wode elf can still stab an enemy with a dagger as a free
                    strike, and a greataxe wielding orc fury can still pull out a
                    hand axe and hurl it at a flying enemy staying annoyingly
                    out of melee range as a free strike.
                    <br><br>
                    See <b>Free Strikes (Action)</b> for more information.

                <v-expansion-panel-title>
                  8. Complication
                </v-expansion-panel-title>
                <v-expansion-panel-text>
                    Complications represent those dramatic moments in a
                    character’s backstory that give them pathos, a dramatic
                    reason to be an outsider, to doubt the meaning of their life,
                    to avoid intimacy, or rage against an enemy from their
                    past. Complications grant a benefit and a drawback. They
                    can make a character more three dimensional, but they are
                    not necessary for making a great hero. Check with your
                    Director to make sure your game is using them.
                    <br><br>
                    See <b>Complications</b> for more information.

                <v-expansion-panel-title>
                  9. Determine Details
                </v-expansion-panel-title>
                <v-expansion-panel-text>
                    Once you’ve created your hero, it’s time to determine the
                    additional details of their backstory, appearance, and
                    personality. How do the events of their culture, career,
                    inciting incident, and class tie together into a cohesive
                    narrative? What’s their name? What do they look like? Do
                    they have any cool scars? Any dope tattoos? Do they still
                    sleep with their teddy bear? These sorts of details can help
                    define a well-rounded hero.

            <v-expansion-panel>
                <v-expansion-panel-title>
                 10. Make Connections
                </v-expansion-panel-title>
                <v-expansion-panel-text>
                    Ask the Director if all the heroes start the campaign
                    knowing each other. If they do, talk to the other players
                    and build some connections between your heroes. If you
                    like, you can use the following prompts to make those
                    connections, or to come up with prompts of your own:
                    <br><br>
                    <br>• While fighting a monster, another hero saved your life.
                    What were you battling and who saved you?
                    <br>• In your group, who looks after everyone’s health and
                    well-being and makes sure that all the characters get
                    along? If it’s not you, how do you view this other hero?
                    <br>• Who is the grumpiest member of your party? If it isn’t
                    you, how do you react to that hero’s sour nature? If it is
                    you, how do you react to other characters teasing you or
                    trying to cheer you up?
                    <br>• What’s one thing your fellow heroes know about you
                    that other people do not?
                    <br>• What’s your favorite way to bond with your fellow
                    heroes?
                    <br>• You’ve known one of the other heroes in your party
                    longer than the rest. Who is it, and how did you meet?
                    <br>• Another hero creates food, music, clothing, trinkets, or
                    something else that you enjoy. Who is that hero and
                    what do they make?
                    <br>• Another hero is teaching you a new skill. Who is it, and
                    what are they teaching you?
                    <br><br>
                    Answer these questions with the other players present,
                    and be sure to get a player’s approval if your answer
                    makes use of their character.
