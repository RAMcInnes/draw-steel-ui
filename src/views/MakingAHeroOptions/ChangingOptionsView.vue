    <h1>Changing Character Options</h1>
    <p>
        If you pick a skill, ability, class, or any other option that
        you end up not liking after using it in the game—even your
        character’s ancestry—you can always freely change that
        option between game sessions. If you want to change an
        option during a session, ask your Director. If they say it’s
        fine to swap that option out for something else, go for it.
        You shouldn’t be stuck with an option that makes the
        game less fun for you.
        <br>
        If you’re changing an option out for some reason other
        than fun, such as changing a kit out because you think the
        next adventure is going to require you to have better
        distance with weapon attacks or changing a signature
        ability granted by your class because you think a different
        damage type would be more helpful against undead, you
        must either follow the normal rules for changing that
        option, or if no such rule exists, get permission from your
        Director.

            Optional: Respite Ability Changes
        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            An optional rule the Director can include in your game is
            to allow heroes to change a number of their signature and
            heroic abilities granted by their class as a respite activity.
            This allows heroes to prepare for upcoming encounters
            and try new builds, but it does mean that Directors and
            players are constantly juggling and learning new abilities.
