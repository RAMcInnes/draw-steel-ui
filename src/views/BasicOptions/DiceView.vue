            This game uses ten-sided dice (also called d10s). Each
            player and the Director should have two of these. Some
            ten-sided dice are numbered 0 to 9 while others are
            numbered 1 to 10. In the case of the former, a 0 counts as
            10.

            The game also makes occasional use of a six-sided die
            (called a d6), so it’s helpful if each player has one or two of
            those as well.

            On rare occasions, the rules ask a player to roll one or
            more three-sided dice (also called d3s). If you don’t have a
            d3, you can roll a six-sided die instead, treating a roll of 1–
            2 as a 1, a roll of 3–4 as a 2, and a roll of 5–6 as a 3.

            D100s
        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            Some tables in this book ask the Director to roll a d100. To
            roll a d100, grab two ten-sided dice. One die represents
            the tens digit, and the other die is the ones digit. If you roll
            a 5 for the tens digit and a 3 for the ones digit, the number
            rolled is 53.
            Some ten-sided dice are numbered 0 to 9 while others are
            numbered 1 to 10. A 10 on the latter counts as a 0 for the
            purposes of rolling a d100. If a 10 is rolled for the tens
            digit and a 9 is rolled for the ones digit, the number rolled
            is 09 or 9.
