            Game of Exceptions
        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            This game has a fair number of rules. But it also has plenty
            of character options, specialized equipment, and other
            game elements that let you break those rules. This is on
            purpose! Breaking the rules allows heroes to feel special
            and makes their foes seem extra dangerous.
            <br>
            If you’re not sure what to do when two rules come into
            conflict with each other, remember that a specific
            exception always beats a more general rule. The Director
            has the final say in how rules are adjudicated.

            Always Round Down
        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            There are times when the rules tell you to divide a number
            in half. Whenever you divide an odd number in half and it
            results in a decimal, round the result down to the nearest
            whole number. For instance, if you have a speed of 7 and
            become slowed (a condition that halves your speed), then
            your speed becomes 3.

            Creatures and Objects
        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            This game uses the terms “creature” and “object.”
            Creatures are living or unliving beings such as animals,
            elves, humans, dragons, giants, zombies, and valok. Objects
            are inanimate matter such as walls, carriages, cups,
            swords, ropes, coins, paintings, columns, and buildings.
           <br><br>
            When a creature dies, their body becomes an object, and
            can be affected by abilities and other effects that target
            objects. For example, a talent can’t use their Telekinesis
            power to slide an unwilling enemy cult leader into an evil
            temple’s pit of hellfire. But if that boss dies, the talent can
            slide their body into the pit to prevent the boss from being
            raised as a powerful undead by the temple’s magic.
            <br><br>
            The game sometimes refers to “unattended objects,” which
            are objects that aren’t held, worn, or controlled by a
            creature. Whenever an ability affects objects, it affects only
            unattended objects unless the Director determines
            otherwise. Among other things, this prevents abilities
            from being used to damage a foe’s armor, weapons,
            clothing, magic items, and so forth while those objects or
            worn or held.

            Supernatural or Mundane
        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            The word "Supernatural" is used to describe abilities,
            creatures, and objects that are magical or psionic in nature.

            The word "Mundane" is used to describe abilities, creatures,
            and objects that aren’t magical or psionic.

            PCs and NPCs
        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            Two types of characters inhabit the world of the game—
            the player characters (also called PCs or heroes) who are
            created and controlled by the players, and nonplayer
            characters (NPCs) created and controlled by the Director.
            NPCs can include any of the game’s monsters, but when
            the rules refer to NPCs, they generally do so in the context
            of interacting with them outside of combat.
