    <h1>Respite</h1>
    <p>
        A respite is a focused period of rest and recuperation that
        allows heroes to regain Stamina and Recoveries. During a
        respite, you must spend 24 hours uninterrupted and doing
        nothing but sleeping, eating, dressing your wounds, and
        recuperating in a safe place. You can also undertake one
        respite activity, such as making a project roll <i>(see
        Downtime Projects</i> in future packets for more
        information), or changing your kit <i>(see Kits)</i>. After 24
        hours, your respite ends. You can take as many respites as
        you like in a row to keep accomplishing respite
        activities—just know that while you’re resting, the
        enemies are still scheming and carrying out their
        dastardly plans.
        <br><br>
        When you finish a respite, you regain all your Recoveries
        and Stamina, and your Victories convert to Experience. It
        is best to take a respite in a safe place where you aren’t in
        a hostile environment or at risk of being attacked. If your
        respite is interrupted by enemies attacking, an earth
        tremor, swarms of biting insects, and similar serious
        distractions, the respite ends early and you don’t gain the
        benefits for finishing it.
        <br><br>
        The standard eightish hours of sleep one gets at night
        doesn’t count as a respite. The rules assume that all heroes
        take the time to sleep, eat, and take care of all the other
        functions necessary for life even if they aren’t engaged in a
        respite.
