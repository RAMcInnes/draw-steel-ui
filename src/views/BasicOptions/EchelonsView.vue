    <h1>Echelons of Play</h1>
    <p>
        The core gameplay experience of Draw Steel takes place
        over 10 levels of play. At 1st level, player characters are
        already known as heroes and have the power to save their
        local village. By 10th level, people all over the world know
        the names of their saviors … maybe all the worlds!
        <br>
        Since this game encompasses power levels from
        hometown to demigods, the core experience ha
        s been divided into four different echelons, which indicate the
        types of threats the heroes take on, the stakes of their
        stories, and the rewards they receive at various levels of
        play

                1st Echelon (Levels 1-3)
            </v-expansion-panel-title>
            <v-expansion-panel-text>
                The 1st echelon of play encompasses levels 1 to 3. At this
                echelon, the player characters are local heroes. They save
                lost caravans, besieged villages, and overlooked
                neighborhoods of cities. The heroes battle bands of mortal
                humanoids — dwarves, elves, goblins, humans, kobolds,
                orcs. They face the occasional larger monstrous threat,
                such as a bredbeddle, ogre, or chimera. These are the
                kinds of creatures that can threaten a small community,
                but rarely have plans for world domination or the
                destruction of the timescape. However, the adversaries
                might work for or be manipulated by a stronger threat as a
                foreshadowing of what awaits the hero at higher echelons.

                2nd Echelon (Levels 4-6)
            </v-expansion-panel-title>
            <v-expansion-panel-text>
                The 2nd echelon of play encompasses levels 4 to 6. At this
                echelon, heroes are now known throughout wider region
                they serve. In Vasloria, this means that they’re saving and
                celebrated by an entire country. In Capital, their
                reputation and work now encompasses several different
                neighborhoods of the enormous city. Heroes of the
                timescape might be known for saving a planet!
                <br>
                Heroes in this echelon battle humanoids of great
                supernatural power, such as draconians, devils, and
                hobgoblins. The bosses they face possess cunning and
                ambition as great as their terrible power, such as medusas
                and overminds. Heroes are this level also face the
                humanoid threats of earlier levels, but these foes are their
                villainous counterparts of equal power instead of bands of
                ruffians or marauding armies.

            </v-expansion-panel-title>
            <v-expansion-panel-text>
                The 3rd echelon of play encompasses levels 7 to 9. At this
                echelon, heroes are saving and known throughout the
                setting where they serve. Most folks in Vasloria, Capital, or
                the timescape itself know of the heroes and are grateful
                for their efforts saving the continent, massive city, or many
                worlds, respectively. Foes at this echelon include beings of
                great power, such as giants, vampires, and valok.

            </v-expansion-panel-title>
            <v-expansion-panel-text>
                The 4th echelon of play encompasses level 10 (and
                possibly beyond in future products). At this echelon,
                heroes are saving the entire timescape from threats like
                liches, powerful dragons, and Ajax the Invincible.
