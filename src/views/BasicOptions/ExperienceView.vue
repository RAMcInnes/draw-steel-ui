        Victories temporarily increase a hero’s power during an
        adventure, but Experience (or XP) permanently improves
        their capabilities. Each time you finish a Respite, you
        gain XP equal to your Victories, then your
        Victories drop to 0. In other words, your Victories are
        converted to XP when you finish a respite.

        For more information on how XP increases your hero’s
        power, see <i>Heroic Advancement</i>.
