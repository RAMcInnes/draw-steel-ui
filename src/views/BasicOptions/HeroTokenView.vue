    <h1>Hero Tokens</h1>
    <p>
        In all great heroic stories, luck favors the protagonists,
        giving them that little bit of extra fortune they need to win
        the day. In these stories, fate is often on the side of the
        righteous.
        <br>
        To represent that tiny bit of karma, players have access to
        hero tokens, a special resource that they can rely on when
        all else fails.
        <br>
        Hero tokens are a group resource that is tracked by the
        players and kept in a pool that is accessible to all their
        characters. They can be tracked using poker chips, stones,
        or other markers or numerically on a piece of paper or
        written off to the side in a virtual tabletop.

            Earning Hero Tokens
        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            At the start of a new game session, the heroes have a
            number of hero tokens equal to the number of heroes in
            the party.
            <br>
            The heroes can earn more tokens through play by taking
            big risks to save others. A hero who leaps off a cliff to get
            the bottom and aid a friend, who crosses a burning bridge
            to save a stray cat, or who wagers their most prized
            treasure as part of a negotiation to get shelter for a group
            of refugees earns a hero token for the group. The Director
            has the final say in what acts earn hero tokens.
            <br>
            Players can also be awarded hero tokens as part of a test’s
            outcome when they succeed in a task with a reward (see
            Tests).

            Spending Hero Tokens
        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            Whenever hero tokens are available, you can spend them
            in the follow ways. You can only spend one hero token on
            your turn or per test:
            <br>• You can spend a hero token to gain two surges.
            <br>• You can spend a hero token when you fail a saving
            throw to succeed on it instead.
            <br>• When you fail a test or succeed on a test with a
            consequence, you can spend a hero token to turn the
            failure into a success and to lose any consequence
            suffered.
            <br>• You can spend 2 hero tokens on your turn or whenever
            you take damage (no action required) to regain Stamina
            equal to your Recovery value without spending a
            Recovery.
            <br><br>
            Unless the Director decides otherwise, unused hero tokens
            disappear at the end of a session. A Director may lift this
            restriction if the heroes end a session with more hero
            tokens than they had at the start.
