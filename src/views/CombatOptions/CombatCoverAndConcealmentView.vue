            When you have line of effect to a creature or object but
            that target has at least half their form blocked by a solid
            obstruction such as a tree, wall, or overturned table, the
            target has cover. <b>You take a bane on abilities that deal
            damage against creatures or objects that have cover from
            you.</b>

        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            Darkness, fog, invisibility magic, and any other effect that
            fully obscures a creature but doesn’t protect their body
            grants that creature concealment. You can target a
            creature who has concealment with strikes, provided they
            aren’t hidden (see Hide and Sneak in Adventuring).
            <b>However, strikes against such creatures take a bane.</b> Even
            if you have line of effect to a creature, they have
            concealment from you if you can’t see them.

            <h3>INVISIBLE CREATURES</h3>
            Invisible creatures always have concealment from other
            creatures. If an invisible creature isn’t hidden, they can
            still be targeted with abilities, though strikes against them
            take a bane. <b>The test made to find a hidden creature who is
            invisible takes a bane.</b>
