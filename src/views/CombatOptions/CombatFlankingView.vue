    <h1>Flanking</h1>
    <p class="mx-3">
        When you and at least one ally are adjacent to the same
        enemy and on completely opposite sides of the enemy, you
        are flanking that enemy. <b>While flanking an enemy, you
        gain an edge on melee strikes against them.</b>
        <br><br>
        If you’re unsure whether your hero and an ally are
        flanking a foe, imagine a line extending from the center of
        your space to your ally’s space. If that line passes through
        opposite sides or corners of the enemy’s space, then you
        and your ally are flanking the enemy.
        <br><br>
        You must have line of effect to the enemy and be able to
        take triggered actions in order to gain or grant the flanking
        benefit.
