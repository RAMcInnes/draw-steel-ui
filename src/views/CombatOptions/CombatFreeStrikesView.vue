    <h1>Free Strikes</h1>
    <p>
        Every creature can use a free strike ability as an action on
        their turn, though doing so typically isn’t the most
        effective choice. Most of the time, you’ll use free strikes
        when the rules call for it. Specific rules let you use free
        strikes as part of an action that allows you to also do
        something else impactful, such as how the Charge action
        lets you move and use a melee free strike in one action
        (see <i>Charge (Action)</i>).
        <br>
        Many rules and abilities allow heroes to make free strikes
        when it isn’t their turn, such as the tactician’s Overwatch
        ability. As well, all characters can make an opportunity
        attack free strike.

            Some abilities, like the Tactician’s "Strike Now" ability, allow
            one creature to target another an let them use a signature
            or heroic action. Unless otherwise stated, you can always
            use a free strike in place of the action granted.

            Opportunity Attacks
        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            Whenever a creature adjacent to you moves to a space that
            isn’t adjacent to you without shifting, you can take
            advantage of their movement to quickly make a melee free
            strike against them as a free triggered action. This is called
            an opportunity attack.
            <br>
            If you have a bane or double bane on the power roll
            against the creature, you can’t make the free strike.

            Standard Free Strikes
        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            Every hero has two standard free strike abilities available
            to them. Your class might give you additional free strike
            options, and your kit can improve the standard options
            (see <i>Kits</i>).
            <br>
            A melee weapon free strike is a melee strike made with an
            unarmed strike or an improvised weapon. A ranged
            weapon free strike is a ranged strike made with an
            improvised weapon. At the Director’s discretion, the
            damage type of an improvised weapon can change based
            on the object used. For example, if you use a burning torch
            as an improvised weapon, it could deal fire damage.
