    <h1>End of Combat</h1>
    <p>
        At the end of combat, the Director determines if the heroes
        each gain any Victories. Any effect or condition affecting
        you that you suffered during combat (except for being
        winded, unconscious, or dying) ends if you want it to.
    </p>

            How Combat Ends
        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            The Director determines when a combat encounter is over.
            While some battles—especially showdowns with
            important villains—can be about a fight to the bitter end,
            many other encounters can become a tedious slog if the
            heroes need to fight until every last enemy’s Stamina is
            reduced to 0.
            <br>
            To avoid a battle dragging, the Director can set objectives
            when they build the encounter. Once the heroes achieve
            those objectives, or if it becomes clear that they can win
            the fight with minimal effort, the Director can end the
            encounter. They might do so by calling “Cut!” like a film
            director, or can use some other phrase or indicator.
            When the Director ends combat this way, the players
            typically choose how the battle ends by narrating a
            dramatic finish. Or in rarer cases when the heroes achieve
            a major objective that sets off a story-defining event, the
            Director narrates the end of the battle with a positive
            outcome for the players, called an event ending (see
            below).
            <br><br>
            <h3>FLEEING FOES</h3>
            If you’ve played an RPG like this one before, odds are you’ve had
            an encounter where you didn’t chase down every last fleeing
            foe—and then one such foe grabbed another bunch of evil
            buddies and came back to ambush you. It takes only one
            experience like this to create players who promise, “No survivors.
            No mercy!” whenever foes break ranks. Chasing down every last
            foe can be fun once in a while, but it can easily turn a tactical
            encounter into a slog.
            <br>
            Luckily, this is a heroic game. Although the Director can surprise
            the players with dramatic reveals and twisty-turny stories,
            “Gotcha!” moments that make players suspicious of every
            fleeing bandit shouldn’t be part of those stories. If a bandit is
            fleeing an encounter, they’re running away to rethink their life. If
            they’re going for help, the players should get some sense of
            that—for example, the bandit screaming at the top of their lungs
            for help as they run toward their leader’s tent. That way, the
            players can process what’s happening, and will understand that
            stopping that fleeing bandit is part of the challenge of the
            encounter.

            Objective Endings
        </v-card-title>
        While planning a combat encounter, the Director can set
        one or more objectives the heroes can achieve to end the
        encounter without dropping every last foe. Some broad
        categories of objectives are described in this section, but
        the Director should feel free to create their own. As well,
        Directors can always end combat anytime it becomes clear
        that the heroes are going to win an encounter with
        minimal effort, even if they haven’t achieved all the
        objectives.

                </v-expansion-panel-title>
                <v-expansion-panel-text>
                    Sometimes the heroes simply defeat enough of their
                    enemies that the rest don’t stand a chance. For example,
                    the Director might decide that an encounter ends when
                    the heroes have no non-minion enemies remaining, when
                    the heroes outnumber their foes, or when the number of
                    remaining enemies is half of what it was at the start of the
                    encounter.
                    <br>
                    The Director can find more guidelines for ending the
                    encounter for this objective in Monsters.

                    Defeat Specific Foe
                </v-expansion-panel-title>
                <v-expansion-panel-text>
                    A combat encounter might include one or more of the
                    heroes’ enemies commanding the rest, such as a hobgoblin
                    captain leading a group of mercenaries, or one or more
                    particularly powerful foes among a group of weaker ones,
                    such as a pair of tusker demons in a gnoll war band.
                    Because these enemies are the stars of the encounter, if
                    only weak foes are left once the stars are gone, the battle
                    loses its challenge and it’s time to wrap it up. Under such
                    circumstances, the Director can end the combat once those
                    special creatures are defeated.

                    Get The Thing!
                </v-expansion-panel-title>
                <v-expansion-panel-text>
                    Classic heroic fantasy is full of important objects that the
                    heroes must protect from the forces of evil: magic rings,
                    royal birth certificates, dragon eggs, and the like. Heroes
                    often find themselves at violent odds with their enemies as
                    they race to collect a valuable or important item from a
                    guarded temple or castle, or when they need to steal the
                    item from a group of enemies already in possession of it.
                    Objectives in this category work well when paired with
                    other objectives. For instance, the heroes must steal a
                    ledger containing a record of criminal activity from an
                    overmind and her lackeys. However, even if they obtain
                    the ledger, the battle won’t be over until they also defeat
                    the overmind, who won’t let the book go without a fight!

                    Destroy The Thing!
                </v-expansion-panel-title>
                <v-expansion-panel-text>
                    Combat doesn’t always have to be about destroying your
                    enemies. Sometimes it’s about destroying their stuff!
                    Burning a pirate captain’s vessel, closing a portal to the
                    Abyssal Wasteland before it lets in an army of demons, or
                    shutting down a massive kobold trap made of spinning
                    blades could so hamper the heroes’ foes that the battle is
                    no longer worth fighting once the damage is done.

                <v-expansion-panel-text>
                    No one earns the mantle of hero without saving a few lives.
                    Sometimes the point of an encounter isn’t to kill, but to
                    save as many folks as you can.
                    <br>
                    If the heroes rescue a powerful ally from the clutches of
                    their foes during combat, the added strength of that ally
                    might be enough to make the remainder of the encounter
                    trivial. When you and your allies save a griffon from a
                    crew of poachers, the hunters become the … well, you
                    know the rest.

                <v-expansion-panel-text>
                    Surprising as it may seem, sometimes the fate of the
                    mission doesn’t rest on the heroes’ shoulders at all!
                    Sometimes it rests on the shoulders of someone standing
                    next to the heroes. The heroes’ job is to keep this
                    important person safe as they travel to a specific
                    destination.
                    <br>
                    Sometimes the heroes are tasked with protecting a
                    helpless or even an actively troublesome creature, such as
                    a hapless noble or a wayward child. They might even have
                    to protect a bulky or inconvenient inanimate object.
                    Whatever the case, the enemies just keep coming until the
                    heroes get their charge to their destination.

                </v-expansion-panel-title>
                <v-expansion-panel-text>
                    Sometimes the heroes just need to buy time. They might
                    need to battle a conquering tyrant’s army to allow
                    innocent villagers time to escape. They might need to hold
                    off wave after wave of zombies while a group of priests
                    completes a ritual to lay the undead to rest for good. To
                    achieve this objective, the heroes need to stay alive and
                    protect a particular position for a number of rounds
                    determined by the Director.

                <v-expansion-panel-text>
                    The enemy holds a strategically important position and
                    the heroes want it. In a reverse of the Hold Them Off
                    encounter, the heroes seize the enemy’s defensive position.
                    The encounter ends when the heroes secure this spot for
                    themselves, even if there are more enemies outside of it.
                    Those enemies likely know better than to assault that
                    position on a whim, because they just held it!

                <v-expansion-panel-text>
                    Sometimes combat is complicated by the fact that the
                    heroes need to stop the villainous actions of their foes. It’s
                    not enough to simply defeat the warriors in a cult. The
                    heroes must also stop the zealots’ archdevil-summoning
                    ritual! Or it might be that the heroes need to interrupt a
                    wedding and make sure an evil mage doesn’t marry the
                    heir to the throne. Despite combat, the mage forces the
                    ceremony to continue! Objectives in this category often
                    have a timer associated with them. If the heroes don’t
                    achieve the objective in a certain number of rounds, the
                    conditions of the battle should change. For instance, if the
                    cultists summon the archdevil, defeating the devil
                    suddenly becomes the heroes’ new objective!

                    The opposite of “Stop the Action,” this objective ending
                    sees the characters charged with initiating an event,
                    performing a ritual, and so forth. For instance, if the
                    heroes are attempting to launch an airship while repelling
                    a time raider boarding party, the encounter could be over
                    the moment the heroes manage to activate the vessel and
                    take off with just a few time raiders actually aboard.

            Dramatic Finish

        <v-card-text>
            If the heroes are able to end a fight with a dramatic finish,
            the Director assigns each hero one or more of their
            remaining enemies, then asks that hero’s player to
            describe how the hero neutralizes that enemy. The hero
            might deliver a killing blow, knock their foe out, or let the
            enemy flee with their tail between their legs (literally or
            figuratively). If the fight has more heroes than Director-
            controlled enemies, the Director can assign more than one
            hero to an enemy, then ask the players how their
            characters work together to bring that enemy down. After
            everyone gives a description, the battle ends.

            Event Ending
        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            If the Director calls the end of combat when a specific
            objective in an encounter is achieved, the event ending
            creates a big narrative finish. The Director can pick a
            narrative trigger for an event ending before an encounter
            begins, or can come up with one on the fly if that makes
            more sense.
            <br>
            Event endings can cover big scenarios such as the
            characters destroying a dam to unleash a river upon their
            enemies, or completing a ritual that causes all the demons
            they’ve been battling to be sent back to the Abyssal
            Wasteland, accompanied by visual details. For example, if
            the heroes are battling a necromancer who controls a
            horde of zombies, the undead might all crumble to dust
            when the necromancer is defeated. If the heroes destroy
            an eldritch machine sapping the land of its natural energy,
            the shockwave from the device’s destruction could
            vaporize the cultists attempting to protect it.
