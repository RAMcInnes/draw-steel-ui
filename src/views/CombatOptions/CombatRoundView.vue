    <h1>Combat Round</h1>
    <p class="mx-3">
        Combat takes place over a series of rounds. During a
        round, each creature in the battle takes a turn. Once every
        creature has taken a turn, a new round begins.

            When Does Combat Start?
        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            Combat begins as soon as one creature intends to harm
            another. This means that even before the action happens, a
            hero can’t use a heroic abilities without spending their
            resources on it, because combat has already begun!

            Determine Surprise
        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            When battle begins, the Director determines which
            creatures, if any, are caught off guard. Any creature who
            isn’t ready for combat at the start of an encounter is
            surprised until the end of the first round of combat. A
            surprised creature can’t take triggered or free triggered
            actions and ability power rolls against them gain an edge.
            <br><br>
            For example, if the heroes sneak up unnoticed on a camp
            of marauders and attack, each marauder is surprised.
            Likewise, if the heroes fail to notice that all the cloaked
            figures in a tavern are actually brain-devouring zombies,
            then the heroes are surprised. If one of the heroes notices
            the disguised undead before the zombies attack but has no
            opportunity to warn their allies, that hero isn’t surprised
            but the rest of the characters are.

            Determine Who Goes First
       </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            Sometimes figuring out who gets to take the first turn in
            combat is automatic. If all the creatures on one side are
            surprised, then a creature on the other side gets to go first.
            <b>But if both sides have creatures who aren’t surprised, the
            Director or a player they choose rolls 1d10. On a result of
            6 or greater, the heroes’ side acts first. Otherwise the other
            side acts first.</b>

            Creatures Take Turns
      </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            <b>Whichever side goes first chooses a creature (or
            sometimes a group of creatures on the Director’s side) to
            act at the start of combat. Whenever the rules talk about a
            creature acting in combat, that creature gets to take their
            turn. When that turn is over, the other side chooses a
            creature to act. Play continues back and forth this way as
            each creature takes their turn.</b>
            <br><br>
            Unless an ability or special rule allows them to do so, any
            creature who has taken a turn during a round can’t act
            again until a new round begins. To help track which
            creatures have already acted in the current round, each
            creature can have a coin, token, or card they flip over on
            the table, or some kind of flag they set on their virtual
            tabletop token, once they’ve taken a turn. That way, all the
            players know who has already acted and who hasn’t.
            <br><br>
            In many encounters, a point comes when one side has
            creatures who haven’t acted yet but all the creatures on
            the other side have. The creatures who have yet to act get
            to take their turns in any order they choose, without turns
            in between from the other side. For example, consider four
            heroes taking on six enemies. When all four heroes have
            taken their turns and four of the enemies have taken theirs,
            the two enemies who are left take their turns one after the
            other to end the round.
            <br><br>
            Once all creatures on both sides of a battle have acted, the
            round ends and a new one begins. The side whose
            members acted first during the starting round of combat
            acts first in all subsequent rounds.
            <br><br>
            <h3>DETERMINING WHO ACTS NEXT</h3>
            When it comes to the heroes’ side, the choice of who
            should act next is intended to give players the opportunity
            to comment, strategize, and plan. Some tables, in some
            encounters, might find that the choice of who should act
            next isn’t obvious, leading to debate. That’s fine.
            Deliberating about what the group should do next is
            classic roleplaying.
            <br><br>
            In general, though, most groups find that it’s usually only
            one or two players in a given round who think it best if
            they act next. And as soon as those players explain why
            they want to act next and what they plan on doing, the
            issue is quickly resolved.
            <br><br>
            <h3>ENEMIES ACT IN GROUPS</h3>
            Director-controlled creatures act in groups, with
            information for building groups found in the Bestiary.
            When a group of enemies acts, the Director chooses a
            single creature or minion squad to take a turn. Once that
            turn is over, the Director chooses another creature in that
            group to take a turn, continuing until all members of the
            group have taken their turn.
