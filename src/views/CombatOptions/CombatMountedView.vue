    <h1>Mounted Combat</h1>
    <p>
        A willing allied creature with the Mount role (see <i>Creature
        Roles in Monsters</i>) can serve as your mount as long as
        their size is greater than yours. You can climb onto your
        mount freely (see <i>Climbing Other Creatures</i>). You
        determine which space you occupy. While mounted you
        can take the Ride move action, but a mount can only be
        ridden this way once per round.
        <br>
        If a creature riding a mount is force moved, they are
        knocked off the mount, and must make a test to determine
        how they land (see <i>Climbing Other Creatures</i>). If a mount
        is force moved, they carry any riders with them. Riders
        and mounts teleport separately.
        <br>
        If your mount dies, they fall prone and you fall off them
        and land prone in the closest unoccupied space of your
        choice.
