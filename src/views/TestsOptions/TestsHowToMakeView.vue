    <h1> How to Make a Test</h1>
    Each test has the following steps:
    <br>
    <br>• The Director decides that a hero’s actions call for a test
    and asks the hero’s player to make a power roll using an
    appropriate characteristic. The Director then selects a
    difficulty for the power roll, either secretly or publicly
    (see <i>Difficulty and Outcomes</i>).
    <br>• The player makes the power roll. If the character has a
    skill that applies to the test (see Skills), they can ask the
    Director if the skill applies. The player must justify the
    use of the skill to the Director. If the Director agrees the
    skill applies, the hero gains a +2 bonus (<u>not an edge but
    a bonus</u>) to the roll.
    <br>• The player reports the result, and the Director
    interprets the success or failure of the roll.

        Though the Director can decide to call for tests in any
        circumstances, a number of tasks that heroes routinely
        undertake are commonly set up as tests.

                <v-expansion-panel-text>
                    You make a Might test whenever a risky task calls for the
                    use of physical strength. Might tests are most often used
                    for breaking down doors and other structures, hurling
                    heavy objects, pulling your body up a sheer wall,
                    swimming against a mighty current, and other feats of
                    physical power.

                <v-expansion-panel-text>
                    You make an Agility test whenever a risky task calls for the
                    use of your physical coordination and nimbleness. Agility
                    tests are most often used for tumbling, sneaking, picking
                    locks, and engaging in sleight of hand.

                <v-expansion-panel-text>
                    You make a Reason test whenever you attempt a risky task
                    that requires the use of your mental acumen and
                    education, formal or otherwise. Reason tests are most
                    often used to recall lore, deduce information based on
                    clues, complete a puzzle, forge counterfeit items or
                    documents, break a code, convince others of a logical
                    argument, or make an estimation.

                <v-expansion-panel-text>
                    You make an Intuition test whenever you attempt a risky
                    task that requires the use of your powers of observation
                    and instinct. Intuition tests are most often used to notice
                    hidden creatures or details, discern another person’s
                    motivations or honesty, calm and reassure others, and
                    train animals.

                <v-expansion-panel-text>
                    You make a Presence test whenever you attempt a risky
                    task that requires the use of your force of personality.
                    Presence tests are most often used to gain trust, project
                    confidence, and influence and lead other creatures.
