    <h1>Tests Overview</h1>
    <p class="mx-3">
        When you want your hero to rifle through a desk and
        locate a specific document, scale a castle wall, negotiate a
        treaty with a monarch, or undertake any other activity
        with a chance of failure, you’ll need to make a test to
        determine how successful you are on the task. A test is any
        power roll that has failure or consequences as an option

            When to Make a Test
        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            The Director should ask a player to make a test only when
            the player’s hero attempts a task where the consequences
            of failure are interesting or dramatic, and where failure
            won’t grind the story to a halt. For example, if a hero
            wants to leap over a waist-high wall while casually
            walking through a peaceful city neighborhood, the worst
            case for failure is probably that the hero falls on their butt,
            takes no damage, and can stand up to either try again or
            walk around the wall. As such, no test is required. But if
            the hero were being chased by enemies, failing to leap
            over the wall means the pursuers can catch them, so the
            Director might decide to call for a test to determine what
            happens.
            <br><br>
            The advancement of a story shouldn’t be halted by failing a
            test. For instance, the heroes might need to know the color
            of a dwarf king’s crown to solve a puzzle, with that puzzle
            opening the only entrance to a tomb they must enter to
            stop a world-ending ritual. It could be that a successful
            Reason test allows the heroes to recall that lore, but the
            test shouldn’t be their only option to get the information. If
            the test fails, perhaps the heroes need to go to a flying
            library to do research, or they might be able to delve into a
            ruin to find the ancient monarch’s portrait. A failed test
            should always result in a story becoming more interesting,
            not in the action coming to an end.

            It Just Works!
        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            When a hero attempts to solve a task that normally
            requires a test with clever, outside-the-box thinking, the
            Director can instead decide that no test is required and the
            attempt automatically works! For example, if a hero who
            wants to climb a wall first covers their hands and feet in
            giant strands of sticky spider webs, the Director might
            decide that they can climb up the wall without needing to
            make a test.
            <br><br>
            That said, such clever ideas often work for free the first
            time, but the Director could decide they require tests if
            they are used again.

            How Long Does It Take?
        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            The amount of time required for a task involving a test is
            determined by the Director. A task such as recalling lore
            with a Reason test might take no time at all. Ducking
            behind a barrel to hide with an Agility test might require a
            maneuver or an action, while tracking a band of voiceless
            talkers through the World Below could take hours or even
            days.

            <h3>Tests During Combat</h3>
            Many (but not all) tests that a hero might make during
            combat are made as maneuvers. See <i>Make a Test</i> in
            <i>Maneuvers</i> for more information.

            Can I Try Again?
        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            In many cases when you fail a test, you can’t attempt the
            test again unless the circumstances of the test change. For
            instance, if you attempt an Agility test to pick a lock and
            fail, you can’t attempt to pick the lock again unless you get
            some better lockpicks, oil the lock, have someone
            demonstrate how to pick a similar lock, and so on.
            <br><br>
            The Director decides when the circumstances have
            changed enough to allow a new attempt at a test.
