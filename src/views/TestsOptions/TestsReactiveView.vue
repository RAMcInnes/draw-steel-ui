    <h1>Reactive Tests</h1>
    <p>
        At certain times when a hero isn’t engaged in overcoming
        a task, the Director might ask the player of the hero to
        make a test without context, explaining the test only after
        the power roll is made. This often happens when a hero
        has a chance of knowing or noticing something of
        significance that the player doesn’t know to look for or ask
        about.
        <br>
        Reactive tests are typically made in the following
        circumstances, though the Director can call for them in any
        appropriate scenario:

        <v-card-text>
            <b>Hidden Environmental Features</b>. The Director asks for
        an Intuition test to notice a secret door, a hidden trap,
        or some other disguised environmental feature.
        <br>
        <b>Hidden Monsters</b>. The Director calls for an Intuition test
        to notice a hidden monster (or they could use the rules
        in NPCs Roll for Deceptive Tasks).
        <br>
        <b>Hidden Motives</b>. The Director can ask for an Intuition test
        during a conversation to gauge how well a hero can
        read an NPC, judging whether they’re lying, withholding
        information, or concealing an emotional response. (The
        Director could also use the rules in NPCs Roll for
        Deceptive Tasks.)
        <br>
        <b>Recall Lore</b>. The Director might ask a hero to make a
        Reason test when dealing with a new object, a piece of
        information, or an event to see what history or details
        the hero might already know about it.
