        If an NPC still has patience after making an offer and their
        interest is between 1 and 4, the heroes can make another
        argument to attempt to improve the deal. Alternatively,
        they can accept the offer and end the negotiation. Let the
        players drive this decision. You can always have an NPC
        show they have patience remaining by asking, “Is there
        anything else?”
        <br><br>
        If the NPC’s patience is 0 or their interest is 5, then the
        offer the NPC makes is their final offer to the characters.
        The heroes can accept the offer or not, but either way, the
        negotiation ends.
        <br><br>
        If the NPC’s interest is 0, the NPC ends the negotiation
        without accepting a deal.
        <br><br>
        The heroes can walk away from a negotiation without
        accepting a deal at any time.
