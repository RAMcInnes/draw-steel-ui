    <h1>Uncovering Motivations</h1>
    <p>
        If a hero wishes to figure out an NPC’s motivations, they
        can begin by simply asking, “What do you want out of this
        deal?” In response, the NPC can willingly hint at or reveal
        one of their motivations, usually by asking for something.
        For instance, a monarch NPC with the greed motivation
        and a penchant for collecting rare animals might suggest
        that the heroes retrieving a griffon egg would earn the
        monarch’s gratitude. The Director can also decide that
        during the natural course of the negotiation, the NPC
        might offer up similar suggestions without the heroes
        asking, provided the NPC already has an interest of at least
        3.
        <br>
        If an NPC isn’t as forthcoming, or if the heroes want to
        learn one of the NPC’s pitfalls, a hero can make a Reason,
        Intuition, or Presence test while interacting with the NPC
        during the negotiation, based on the tactics used to draw
        out the NPC. The test has the following outcomes:
        <br><br>
        <b>Power Roll + Reason, Intuition, or Presence:</b>
        <br>• 11 or lower: The hero learns no information regarding
        the NPC’s motivations or pitfalls, and the NPC realizes
        the hero is trying to read them and becomes annoyed.
        As a consequence, the NPC’s patience is reduced by 1.
        <br>• 12–16: The hero learns no information regarding the
        NPC’s motivations or pitfalls.
        <br>• 17+: The hero learns one of the NPC’s motivations or
        pitfalls (their choice).
        After this test is made, the heroes can’t make another test
        to determine the same NPC’s motivations or pitfalls until
        they make an argument to the NPC or the negotiation ends.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>OUTSIDE OF NEGOTIATION</h3>
    <p>
        While the heroes can discover an NPC’s motivations or
        pitfalls through tests made during negotiation, they can
        employ other methods of investigating motivations or
        pitfalls before negotiation. Research or a little
        reconnaissance (for instance, reading the NPC’s diary or
        talking to their closest friends), can reveal quite a bit
        about a person!
