    <h1>Perks Overview</h1>
    <p>
        Heroes don’t just fight monsters. They engage in
        exploration, investigation, negotiation and more. Perks are
        features you can use to customize your heroes and give
        them heroic moments outside of combat. Perks, along with
        skills and many of your hero’s class features, make your
        character more than a monster fighter. While these
        features are designed to be used outside of combat, many
        are versatile enough that they can also be used in combat.
        <br>
        You get one perk from your career and can choose others
        from your class as your level increases.

            Whenever a feature allows you to gain a perk, it tells you
            which type of perk to choose.
