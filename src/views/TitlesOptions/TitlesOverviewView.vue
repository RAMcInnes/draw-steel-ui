    <h1>Titles</h1>
    <p class="mx-3">
        Titles are special benefits earned by heroes through
        adventure and mighty deeds. Heroes must win titles—
        sometimes individually, sometimes as a group—by
        accomplishing heroic tasks. Titles are the record of a
        hero's accomplishments, forming the basis of the stories
        told of them in taverns or whispered in the halls of the
        mighty.
        <br><br>
        Each title comes with a new ability or other special benefit.
        By earning titles, heroes gain a unique set of capabilities
        that sets them apart from other adventurers.

            Title Requirements
        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            Players don't choose their titles. Like treasure and renown,
            titles must be won.
            <br><br>
            Each title has a unique requirement—you might need to
            defeat a specific monster, research dangerous forbidden
            lore, or, in the case of the Monarch title, win a kingdom!
            <br><br>
            Titles aren't given out on a schedule. Instead, the Director
            grants one whenever heroes perform a deed worthy of it.
            Just as a hero doesn't automatically find a magic weapon
            just because they meet the requirements for using it, they
            don't automatically earn a title unless it's granted by the
            Director.
            <br><br>
            Although the Director gives out titles, players can work
            with the Director towards a specific goal. For instance, a
            player might say, "I'm interested in the Dragon Blooded
            title. Can my hero listen for rumors of any wicked dragons
            nearby that need smiting?" Having ambition is good!
            Pursue the titles you want that will make you a better
            hero!

            Title Echelons
        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            Each title is assigned to an echelon of play where it is most
            likely to be earned. For instance, knighthood is something
            that can be typically earned by the 2nd echelon, while
            becoming a king or queen can usually only be achieved in
            the 4th. But don't let the rules get in the way of a good
            story! If the Director decides that the players somehow
            earn knighthood at level 1, bask in the glory of this great
            accomplishment.
            <br><br>
            If you’re the Director, note that granting a title several
            tiers early may have unwanted effects on the game.
            Higher-echelon titles tend to have more significant
            benefits than lower-tier ones. If a hero becomes queen at
            level 1, her royal responsibilities may overshadow her
            other adventures. Don’t grant a title more than one
            echelon early unless you know what you’re getting into!

        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            In the following pages, you'll find lots of premade titles.
            But the Director can also create custom titles, both to
            reward specific player accomplishments and to flesh out
            organizations, locations, and foes within their own game
            world. When a hero finally achieves a long-term goal after
            many game sessions of struggle, the Director can
            memorialize the moment by granting a unique title.
            Similarly, the Director can grant custom titles when the
            heroes befriend specific factions, defeat notorious villains,
            or learn new moves from skilled NPCs.
            <br><br>
            While the Director can always create titles from scratch,
            the easiest way to create custom titles is to modify an
            existing title's requirements to fit the adventure at hand.
            For instance, maybe your world contains a secretive
            organization of freedom fighters, the Jesters, who never
            carry weapons, defeating foes with unarmed attacks and
            improvised weapons. You could modify the requirements
            of the Brawler title, changing its requirements to "Join the
            Jesters."

            How Many Titles?
        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            Just because a hero meets a perquisite for a title doesn’t
            mean that it is granted to them. The Director decides when
            a hero earns a title and its benefits. Odds are you’ll be
            adventuring quite a bit and qualify for more than a few,
            but too many titles all at once can make for a very
            complicated hero. In general, a hero typically earns one
            title per echelon of play, though they can earn more or
            fewer at the Director’s discretion.
            <br><br>
            If there’s a specific title you want to earn, let your Director
            know. It’s good to have ambition, and they are likely to
            help you make it happen.

            Title Benefits
        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            Some titles have only one benefit. These are typically
            earned individually by heroes instead of together as a
            group. Only the hero doing the studying reaps the reward!
            <br><br>
            Most titles, however, are earned by all the heroes at once
            for accomplishing a great task, benefiting them all. These
            titles typically offer a menu of three or four different
            options. When the party earns the title, each player
            decides which benefit they hero takes. For instance, if the
            party triumphs in a tavern fight and gains the Brawler title,
            one hero might become more adept at fighting with
            improvised weapons, another might learn a special dodge
            to use when flanked by multiple enemies, and two others
            might simply revel in increased notoriety. Any hero can
            take any of a title’s benefits they qualify for, and multiple
            characters can take the same benefit.

            Granting Titles
        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            Titles are rewards for heroic actions, and they often go
            hand in hand with treasure and other goodies. If the party
            defeats a fearsome monster and gains renown, or
            accomplishes a quest and wins a magical leveled item, they
            might earn a title at the same time.
            <br><br>
            There's no hard and fast rule for the number of titles a
            party should accumulate by a certain level. If the party
            wins a title whenever they accomplish a truly notable
            deed—once every few adventures—then they might earn
            about one title per level. Sticking to this rate isn't a
            requirement. A party might easily earn twice or half as
            many titles—they'll just be a bit more or less powerful
            than they otherwise would be. A Director can even skip
            granting titles altogether if they wish.
            <br><br>
            While running a game session, it can be hard to track the
            heroes’ actions and remember which titles they might
            qualify for! It’s easier to plan titles ahead of time. If the
            heroes might face a demon or dragon in an upcoming
            adventure, the Director can include the Demon Blooded or
            Dragon Blooded titles as potential rewards alongside that
            magic cloak or enchanted dagger. A Director can even use
            the titles system to inspire adventures. What challenges
            should a hero face to earn the Demigod title?
            <br><br>
            <h3>OPTIONAL RULE: PLAYERS CHOOSE TITLES</h3>
            If the Director doesn't want to track player accomplishments,
            they can let the players do it instead. In this case, whenever a
            hero enters a new echelon of play, they gain one title of their
            choice for which they qualify.
