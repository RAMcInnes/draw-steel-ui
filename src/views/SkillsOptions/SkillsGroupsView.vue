            Crafting Skills
        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            Skills from the crafting skill group are used in the creation
            and appraisal of goods and for jury-rigging contraptions.
            They are especially useful during rests and downtime.
            <br><br>
            Rewards for tests made with crafting skills typically
            include having leftover rare material used in the creation
            process, knowing a buyer willing to pay extra for goods or
            items you’re appraising, or making a jury-rigged device so
            amazing that it lasts for more uses than it should.
            <br><br>
            Failure consequences for tests made with crafting skills
            typically include wasting rare materials used in the
            creation process, greatly overestimating or
            underestimating an item’s value, and poorly jury-rigging a
            contraption so that it harms people (or at least the wrong
            people).

            Exploration Skills
        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            Skills from the exploration skill group are used to
            physically explore the environment around the characters,
            and to overcome physical obstacles.
            <br><br>
            Rewards for tests made with exploration skills typically
            include helping another creature engaging in the same
            task succeed without needing to also make a test,
            automatically succeeding on a follow-up test while
            engaged in the same task, reaching a destination faster
            than you anticipated, and learning about or avoiding an
            upcoming hazard.
            <br><br>
            Failure consequences for tests made with exploration
            skills include harming yourself, your gear, or your allies,
            becoming lost, or stumbling headlong into a hazard or a
            place you were trying to avoid.

        <v-card-title>
            Interpersonal Skills
        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            Skills from the interpersonal skill group are used to
            socially interact with other creatures, and are particularly
            useful during negotiations. Aside from the Handle Animals
            skill, you can generally only use interpersonal skills when
            you attempt to influence creatures who have emotions and
            who can understand you.
            <br><br>
            Rewards for tests made with interpersonal skills typically
            include gaining an extra favor, item, or piece of
            information from the person or people you interact with.
            <br><br>
            Failure consequences for tests made with interpersonal
            skills include making the person you’re interacting with
            angry, sad, embarrassed, offended, or otherwise upset or
            uncomfortable, which might cause them to ignore you,
            storm off, spread rumors about you, attack you, betray you,
            blackmail you, or otherwise attempt to harm you.

            Intrigue Skills
        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            Skills from the intrigue skill group are used in tasks
            centered around investigation, thievery, and spycraft.
            <br><br>
            Rewards for tests made with skills from this group
            typically include helping another creature engaging in the
            same task succeed without needing to also make a test,
            automatically succeeding on a follow-up test while
            engaged in the same task, discovering helpful information
            in addition to what you set out to learn, and performing an
            extra bit of clandestine activity in addition to what you set
            out to do.
            <br><br>
            Failure consequences for tests made with intrigue skills
            include getting caught in the act or failing to notice a detail
            that places you in danger, such as triggering a trap or
            walking into an ambush.

            Lore Skills
        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            Skills from the lore skill group are used to research and
            recall specific information. They are especially useful
            during rests and downtime.
            <br><br>
            Rewards for tests made with lore skills typically include
            learning an extra piece of useful information.
            <br><br>
            Failure consequences for tests made with lore skills
            typically include learning an incorrect piece of information
            that seems useful, but which actually makes things worse
            or wastes time. (It’s fun to roleplay these sorts of moments,
            so lean in!) Alternatively, the Director can make medium
            and hard lore tests for each hero in secret and let the
            players know the narrative outcome without revealing the
            result of the dice.
