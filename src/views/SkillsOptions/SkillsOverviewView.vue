    <h1>Skills Overview</h1>
    <p>
        Skills represent the different specializations a hero has
        outside of attacking, defending, and using their ancestry
        features, class features, and equipment. Whenever you
        make a test, having a particular skill associated with the
        test increases your chance of success.

            Applying Skills
        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            <b>If you have a skill that applies to a test you make, you gain
            a +2 bonus (not an edge) to the test.</b> For instance, if your
            hero has the Hide skill, you have a +2 bonus to any test
            you make that involves hiding yourself. This might include
            an Agility test to hide behind a barrel, or a Presence test to
            disappear into a crowd.
            <br>
            <b>You can’t apply more than one skill to a test.</b>
            <br><br>
            <h2>Justify The Skill</h2>
            It’s not the Director’s job to know all the skills in this game
            or to know the specific skills your hero has. Instead, the
            Director asks you to make a test with a characteristic and
            you tell the Director if you think you have a skill that
            applies. If it’s not obvious why the skill applies, tell your
            Director how your hero is approaching the task and justify
            why that approach uses the skill. The Director then
            decides if you get the +2 bonus or not. If the Director
            disagrees with you, that’s the final word. Lose gracefully.
            <br>
            If the Director does agree with you, then you get the +2
            bonus from the skill! Approaching problems creatively,
            while remaining reasonable, can help you get the most out
            of your skills. For example, if you’re making a Presence
            test to impress a noble at a party, the Brag skill is obvious
            choice, but what if you don’t have that skill? Maybe you
            could instead try to impress the noble with a Presence test
            that uses the Magic skill (which you do have), as you give a
            brief, exciting lecture about the nature of the elements. If I
            was your Director, I’d allow it!
            <br>
            Sometimes, you won’t have a skill that applies to a test.
            That’s okay! If your characteristic score is decent, you
            likely still have a good chance of success without a skill.
            <h2>Mixing Characteristics and Skills</h2>
            The bonuses from characteristics and the +2 from skills
            are separate and can apply to the same roll. <b>Although
            certain skills are often paired with one characteristic more
            than others, a skill can apply to any characteristic test that
            makes sense.</b> The Director has the final say on which
            characteristic is used to complete a task, and can call for a
            different characteristic based on the circumstances.
            <br>
            For example, intimidating someone with a purely verbal
            threat is a Presence test. But if a player describes their
            character tearing a log in half with their bare hands to
            intimidate a foe, the Director is likely to call for a Might
            test instead. The Intimidate skill applies to both tests. In
            the same way, scaling the side of a building is covered by a
            Might test, but if a hero does a series of leaps from one
            balcony to another to reach a roof, the Director could call
            for an Agility test instead. The Climb skill applies to both of
            these tests.

            Many Specific Skills
        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            This game includes a big list of skills, and each is fairly
            specific. For example, instead of one Athletics skill that
            covers climbing, jumping, swimming, and lifting heavy
            objects, your character might use separate Climb, Jump,
            Lift, and Swim skills. Instead of a Thievery skill that covers
            picking locks, picking pockets, and disabling traps, the
            game has three skills: Pick Lock, Pick Pocket, and Sabotage.
            <br>
            We made the decision to have a lot of specific skills based
            on our design goals. First, having skills this specific means
            that you will frequently make tests that don’t use one of
            your character’s skills and simply apply a characteristic.
            By not having a few broader skills, it means that having a
            character who covers the spread of every skill is actually
            impossible. Luckily, the math of the game doesn’t require
            you to have a skill to have a decent chance of success on a
            test. That means heroes can attempt tasks without the
            help of a skill just because someone needs to do it, and
            that is pretty darn heroic!
            <br>
            <b>Since players don’t need to be worried about their
            characters covering a wide spread of skills, they’re free to
            choose the skills they think fit their heroes best and are
            the most fun to work with. In this way, you can get pretty
            specific with the hero you want to make.</b> Maybe you’re
            thinking about an elementalist who has a gymnastic
            background in jumping and tumbling, and who also
            studied religion and blacksmithing. You can make that in
            our game! Having a specific backstory is part of cinematic
            storytelling.
            <br>
            Our rules for skills allow for them to be flexibly applied to
            any test that is appropriate for the skill. This encourages
            clever thinking. A player can ask the Director, “I want to
            impress the duke with a story about how I ascended the
            sheer Cliffs of Azgahnan. Can I use my Climb skill to get a
            +2 bonus to my Presence test?” That’s great! Getting
            creative like that is a lot of fun. It paints a visual picture,
            and it’s tactical thinking! However, if the skills in a game
            are too broad in the kinds of activities they represent, that
            sometimes encourages players to find a way to apply the
            same skill over and over again with as many tests as
            possible. This isn’t fun for anyone, and doesn’t make a very
            compelling story.
