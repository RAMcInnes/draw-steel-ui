    <h1>Class Overview</h1>
    <p>
        While all your character creation decisions bear narrative
        weight, none influences the way you play the game like
        your choice of class. Your class determines how your hero
        battles the threats of the timescape and overcome other
        obstacles. Do you bend elemental forces to your will
        through the practiced casting of magic spells? Do you
        channel the rage of the Primordial Chaos as you tear across
        the battlefield felling foes left and right? Or do you belt out
        heroic ballads that give your allies a second wind and
        inspire them to greater achievements?
        Your class provides you with your heroic resource, many of
        your features, and most of your abilities. There are nine to
        choose from in this book.

            A talent is the master of psionics, manifesting
            powers that manipulate objects, minds, and time. These
            heroes can reach far into themselves to use abilities even
            when they don’t have enough heroic resources—if
            they’re willing to face the cost.

            Troubadour

        <v-card-text>
            A troubadour inspires their allies with
            storytelling and swordplay that is as much an art as it is
            an act of war. Their quips, songs, poems, and epic tales
            produce actual magic that harms foes and bolsters allies.
            They can even use their magic to tweak the campaign’s
            story in real time to better suit their needs.
