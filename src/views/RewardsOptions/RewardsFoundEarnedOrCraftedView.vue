    <h1>Found, Earned, or Crafted</h1>
    <p>
        The rules of the game account for worlds where the
        average person—sometimes even the average noble—
        doesn’t have regular access to treasures. There might be
        an apothecary in the capital city of a region, but they’re
        selling herbal remedies, not supernatural potions. In
        Vasloria, a town blacksmith isn’t selling magic maces, and
        the local tailor doesn’t make psionic capes. There simply
        aren’t enough treasures readily available to create a good
        trade economy. Word sometimes gets around of
        mysterious clubs where heroes and treasure seekers can
        meet up to swap items, but the constant threat of thieves
        makes such markets difficult to find.
        <br><br>
        Most treasures are found as part of adventures. Many
        people concoct dastardly schemes, but only those with the
        will and power to enact that vision become villains—and
        acquiring treasures of great power is often part of a
        villain’s plans. As such, the heroes who vanquish those
        evildoers often get to claim those treasures for themselves.
        At other times, generous and well-off individuals such as
        monarchs and powerful mages can reward treasures as
        thanks for heroic deeds.
        <br><br>
        Heroes can also craft their own treasures, forging the tools
        they need to get the job done. Items that can be crafted
        have their item prerequisites, project source, project roll
        characteristic, and project goal (the number of project
        points needed to complete the project) noted in their
        descriptions. See Downtime Projects for more information
        about crafting.

    <h3>TREASURE ITEM PREREQUISITES</h3>
    <p>
        Each treasure has an item prerequisite for crafting. The exact
        nature of many of these materials is left nebulous so that the
        Director can more easily work them into a campaign. What’s a
        mindspider and how rare is their silk? That’s for the Director to
        decide. This makes it easier for them to drop it into their planned
        adventures or craft an entire adventure around finding that one
        item.

            Wearing Treasures
        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            Many treasures, such as cloaks, jewelry, hats, and boots,
            must be worn. Unless the Director deems otherwise, these
            items supernaturally resize themselves to fit the creature
            using them.
            <br><br>
            Wearable treasures have keywords that indicate which
            part of the body they are meant to adorn—Arms, Feet,
            Hands, Head, Neck, or Waist. The Ring keyword marks
            treasures typically worn on the finger. You can wear any
            number of treasures that have the same body keyword as
            long as the Director deems it reasonable. For example, it
            might be fine for a four-armed time raider to wear two
            pairs of bracers, but the Director might decide that the
            same hero can’t benefit from wearing two magic cloaks at
            once. If the Director decides you’re wearing too many
            treasures with the same body keyword, none of those
            treasures function.
            <br><br>
            Though body keywords indicate where a treasure is meant
            to be worn, treasures can still function if worn on other
            parts of the body. For example, a hero without ears or who
            just wants to have a different look might wear an earring
            as a piercing anywhere else they desire.
            <br><br>
            If a wearable treasure comes as a set, such as a pair of
            bracers, boots, or earrings, all items in the set must be
            worn to gain the treasure’s benefits.

            Wielding Treasures
        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            Some treasures are wielded in the form of weapons or
            implements. A weapon might have the Light Weapon,
            Medium Weapon, or Heavy Weapon keywords, or might
            have a keyword denoting a specific category of weapon
            (Bow, Polearm, and so forth). An implement might have
            the Implement keyword or a keyword denoting the type of
            implement (Orb, Wand, and so forth). Armor is also
            considered a wielded treasure, with the Light Armor,
            Medium Armor, or Heavy Armor keywords, or the Shield
            keyword.
            <br><br>
            A hero can wield as many weapons, implements, suits of
            armor, or shields as they can feasibly hold or wear.
            However, an ability can benefit only from one weapon or
            implement at a time.
            <br><br>
            <h3>TREASURES AND KITS</h3>
            To gain the benefits of a weapon or armor treasure, the
            treasure must have keywords that match the equipment of
            your kit. For instance, a hero using the Warrior Priest kit
            can benefit from wearing a heavy armor treasure and
            wielding light weapon treasures, since those are part of
            that kit. But they gain no benefit from using treasures that
            are light armor, medium armor, shields, medium weapons,
            or heavy weapons.
            <br><br>
            If your hero doesn’t use a kit, they can’t gain benefits from
            using armor or weapon treasures unless they have a
            feature that says otherwise, such as the conduit’s Prayer of
            Soldier’s Skill.

            Magic And Psionic Treasures
        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            The Magic and Psionic keywords don’t restrict you from
            using specific treasures, such as implements, with specific
            abilities. An implement with the Magic keyword can be
            used to enhance Psionic abilities and vice versa.
            <br><br>
            While treasures can enhance specific abilities, for the
            purpose of the rules, they don’t add the Magic or Psionic
            keyword to abilities that don’t already have them, even if
            they are enhancing those abilities.

            Stamina And Damage Bonuses
        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            If two treasures give a creature a bonus to their Stamina or
            the rolled damage of their abilities, only the higher bonus
            applies unless otherwise noted. The Stamina and damage
            bonuses from consumables ignore this rule and can be
            stacked with other Stamina and damage bonuses granted
            by treasures.
