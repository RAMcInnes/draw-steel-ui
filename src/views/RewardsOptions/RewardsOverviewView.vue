    <h1>Rewards Overview</h1>
    <p class="mx-3">
        Virtue is its own reward … but wouldn’t a magic sword
        also be kinda nice? As heroes adventure, they find and
        craft treasures and earn titles, renown, wealth, and
        followers. This chapter presents all the various rewards a
        hero can earn during their career! As you read over the
        rewards within, make note of the treasures and titles your
        hero would like to earn—then you can start pursing them
        during your adventures.

            Treasures
        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            You’ve helped save the world! Or at least a corner of that
            world important to you. Now you deserve the treasures
            that can help you do so even more efficiently next time. So
            claim your magic sword, psionic shield, and Catapult Dust,
            and let’s ride to adventure!
            <br><br>
            Treasures are the supernatural items that heroes find on
            their adventures, or that they craft themselves to help
            with their heroics. You might claim a magic whip from a
            bandit captain, or create a psionic necklace that will help
            you take down a dread cult.
            <br><br>
            Treasures come in all shapes and sizes, and are broken
            down into four types:

            Consumables
        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            Consumables are treasures that can be used a limited
            number of times before they expire, losing whatever
            makes them supernatural. You can drink a potion once,
            and when you do so, that’s it. It’s consumed. Other
            consumables might have a specific number of charges that
            can be spent. Once those charges are gone, the treasure is
            useless.
            <br><br>
            Consumables are organized by echelon to make life easy
            for the Director handing them out (see Echelons of Play in
            The Basics). As a guideline, a hero should always be able to
            find consumable treasures or the materials required to
            craft consumables of their echelon and lower. For example,
            heroes who are 5th level should be able to find
            consumables of 1st and 2nd echelon. In some cases, the
            Director might decide to award consumables of an echelon
            higher than the heroes’ echelon, but such a choice means
            giving the heroes more power than the encounter-building
            guidelines in Draw Steel: Monsters accounts for.
            <br><br>
            Your character can carry any number of consumables at a
            time.

            Trinkets
        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            Trinkets are treasures that can be used at will without a
            reduction in their potency. They generally provide a small
            benefit, such as allowing you to see farther or become a bit
            better at picking locks.
            <br><br>
            Like consumables, treasures are organized by echelon. You
            can carry any number of trinkets.

            Leveled Treasures
        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            Like trinkets, leveled treasures can be used at will without
            a reduction in potency. However, leveled treasures tap
            into your will in a way that trinkets don’t, becoming more
            powerful and increasing their capabilities as you level up.
            <br><br>
            <h3>Leveled Benefits</h3>
            <p>
                Each leveled treasure has benefits that you gain at 1st, 5th,
                and 9th levels. You can’t use a treasure’s benefit until you
                achieve the appropriate benefits level. Leveled benefits are
                cumulative.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Carry Three Safely</h3>
            <p>
                Your connection with leveled treasures doesn’t just make
                them useful. It also makes them dangerous. Each leveled
                item is a quasi-sentient, purpose-driven entity. A magic
                sword wishes to be used in combat. A psionic censer
                yearns to defy physics and bend reality. As such, a creature
                can safely carry a maximum of three leveled treasures at a
                time. If you carry more leveled treasures, those items
                become jealous of one another and fight for your attention,
                attempting to subconsciously influence you into using
                them—and leaving your other items behind.
                <br><br>
                It’s fine to own or possess more than three leveled
                treasures, as long as the extras are stored away or in the
                possession of other creatures. But if you carry more than
                three leveled treasures, you must make a Presence test
                during each respite:
                <br>
                <br>• 11 or lower: One of your leveled treasures (chosen by
                the Director), grabs hold of your psyche. It forces you to
                sleepwalk or otherwise enter an active fugue state and
                discard the rest of your leveled treasures some place
                that you can’t remember. If you want those items back,
                you’d better get looking before someone else finds them.
                <br>• 12–16: Your items work together to prevent you from
                moving until you pick three items and leave the rest
                behind.
                <br>• 17+: Nothing happens.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>YOU DON'T NEED THREE</h4>
            <p>
                Because you can carry up to three leveled items safely, many
                players assume they should get and carry three. The truth is that
                many heroes get a great benefit from carrying just one or two
                leveled items and have no real need to for a third. That’s totally
                fine! You’ll still be super powerful with just one. You can always
                craft more trinkets and consumables that might serve you better.

            Artifacts
        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            Artifacts are powerful treasures, with entire campaigns to
            be built around finding, using, hiding, protecting, or
            destroying one. Make no mistake—these items unbalance
            the game. If the heroes or villains have access to such a
            treasure, their power is far beyond what the encounter-building
            guidelines expect. That’s part of the fun!
            <br><br>
            Typically, one creature never holds onto an artifact for too
            long. Most of these treasures have a sentience of their own
            and an eagerness to move on. Since many powerful
            entities might want to get their hands on an artifact,
            characters might see armies, dragons, and even gods come
            to collect one from a wilder who refuses to let go.
