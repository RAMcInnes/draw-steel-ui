<h1>IF YOU’RE COMING FROM D20 FANTASY ...</h1>
  <p>
      We know many folks are coming to this game having only
    experienced d20 fantasy RPGs. Here are a few key
    distinctions between this game and typical d20 fantasy
    that you’ll notice right away. These aren’t the only
    distinctions, but they’re the most obvious:

      <v-expansion-panel-text>
        <p>
          You can still have a bad turn! A tier one result is not awesome, but at least
          you’re making progress. The trick is: who’s making progress faster?
          You or the monsters? Since there’s no “I miss, next” in this game, fights tend to be short.
          Five rounds is a long fight. Because everyone’s always doing damage!

          Most d20 fantasy games are games of attrition. Your spell slots
          and other features dwindle as the adventuring day goes on. In
          Draw Steel, you need to rest to regain your Stamina and
          Recoveries (the stat that determine how robust you are
          in combat). But all characters earn the ability to use
          their magic and other awesome abilities as they
          adventure, encouraging you to press on heroically.

        <h2>Character options are different</h2>
      </v-expansion-panel-title>
      <v-expansion-panel-text>
        <p>
          We very strongly recommend you start by looking through
          the character creation section before you decide what you
          want to play. You can’t just assume the conduit is “basically a
          cleric.” In some ways it is! But in other ways it’s very
          different. You may have some cool character archetype
          you love to play in d20 Fantasy and you’re dying to see
          how it works in Draw Steel, but you’ll have a lot more
          fun if you start by browsing the Ancestries and Class
          sections and being inspired. Once you know how the
          game works, you’ll have a better handle on how to build
          your favorite character in here.

        <h2>Smaller bonuses and penalties</h2>
      </v-expansion-panel-title>
      <v-expansion-panel-text>
        <p>
          Draw Steel is built around the roll of two ten-sided dice to produce three
          possible outcomes. On the surface, this might not seem
          that different from rolling a twenty-sided die and having
          two outcomes, but we’ve run the math. A bonus of
          +1 or penalty of −2 is significant in Draw Steel, much
          more so than in a typical d20 fantasy game. That means
          you should feel pretty good attempting most power
          rolls—the rolls you make to determine success out of
          combat—if you have a decent characteristic bonus on
          those rolls. And if you have a specific skill that applies to
          a power roll made as a test outside of combat, you’ll do
          even better.

        <h2> Our game has a lot of skills</h2>
      </v-expansion-panel-title>
      <v-expansion-panel-text>
        <p>
          Your character can make use of a long list of skills,
          but we don’t expect you to memorize that list.
          We get into why there are so many skills in the Tests chapter,
          but the short version is that we think having a lot of skills
          allows you to create more distinct and specialized heroes,
          which supports the sort of gameplay we want to see in Draw Steel.
          And skills in Draw Steel aren’t tied to characteristics.

          You can use Presence to Hide! Why not?

          Beyond what’s noted here, don’t assume that these rules work
          like any d20 fantasy game you’ve played. We don’t have
          the space to point out every exception. So if you’re in
          doubt about how something works, put d20 fantasy out
          of your mind and read our rules without those
          assumptions, and you’ll find that things make better
          sense. If you’re still confused, stop by the MCDM Discord
          and ask. We’ve got tons of awesome community
          members ready to help!

          This is actually one thing Draw Steel does have in common
          with d20 fantasy. This is a big book of rules! Don’t stress
          if you need to look something up or make a ruling about
          an edge case on the fly. If everyone’s having fun, you’re
          doing it right.
