<h1>What this game IS</h1>

        TACTICAL
      </v-card-title>
      <v-card-text>
        <p>
        Strategy is: “What are we trying to do?” Break a siege, free a prisoner, rescue a captive, steal a tome of ancient lore. Strategy is about long-term goals.
        <br>
        Tactics is about: “How are we going to do that?” We’re going to ... surround them! Sneak around them!
        Pick them off one by one! Kill their leader first. Kill their priest first!
        “No resurrections!”
        <br><br>
        In a tactical game, <u>positioning matters</u>. So our game is
        played on a grid. Effects and distances are measured in
        squares. This means everyone is looking at the same
        problem, and there is no ambiguity regarding where the
        heroes and villains are in relation to each other. The
        hobgoblin troopers are setting themselves up in a line to
        stop our tactician and fury from getting into melee with
        the hobgoblin war mage. We can all see that happening,
        and can talk about what we’re going to do to stop it.
        <br><br>
        That means <u>teamwork matters</u>. That’s why initiative works
        the way it does—to encourage the players to plan! “Okay,
        you use Concussive Slam on that trooper, it’ll push him
        back, and on my turn I can use Phalanx Forward to get us
        all into melee with the death captain.”
        We think focusing on teamwork also makes the game
        more heroic! :D
        In a tactical game, you have many choices each round. You
        are never reduced to just swinging your sword. You have
        options. If we do a good job, you don’t feel like you
        outlasted your opponents because you wore their Stamina
        down before they could reduce yours to 0—you feel like
        you beat those hobgoblins! Through stealth and sorcery,
        coordination and ferocity!
        <br><br>
        As you play with the same group of characters, you learn
        what they can all do. You discover synergies, “combos.”
        Some of them intended by the designers, some not! You
        start to learn these unique characters, and rely on them to
        do their cool things. It’s a great feeling when another
        player comes up with a cool plan that relies on your
        unique abilities.
        You learn which characters are the “squishies” who need
        to be protected or healed. You learn which characters can
        push themselves right to the edge and keep fighting. “Don’t
        worry about healing Barlaca. She’s our fury. She’s happier
        with 3 Stamina.”
        <br><br>
        Our game is not about tactics. It’s not a war game. But it is tactical.

        HEROIC
      </v-card-title>
      <v-card-text>
        <p>
          For us, this means a couple of things. It means we don’t
          assume your character is primarily motivated by greed.
          They might be! But we don’t assume that. Instead we
          assume you’re going to do the right thing. It might take
          some convincing, and there might be some reluctant
          heroes in your party, but that’s part of the fun!
          <br><br>
          You should absolutely be able to run a Chain of Acheronstyle
          campaign where the heroes are hard-bitten
          mercenaries in a morally ambiguous world. But that’s not
          the baseline assumption. The fiction and adventures that
          inspire us feature epic villains trying to remake the world
          in their image, and the dashing, unyielding heroes who
          strive against them even in the face of impossible odds.
          <br><br>
          So that’s one component of the heroic keyword. But
          another component, equally important, is what kinds of
          things happen “on-screen,” so to speak. This is very closely
          related to the cinematic keyword.
          <br><br>
          For instance, you never see Indiana Jones having to find a
          local sporting goods store because he needs to stock up on
          ammo. You never see Katniss Everdeen have to stop and
          take a shower because she stinks.
          <br><br>
          These things do happen. No one watching Raiders of the
          Lost Ark thinks that Indy’s gun is magical and doesn’t need
          bullets—but we just don’t need to see Indy doing that stuff.
          We don’t need to waste time on it.
          <br><br>
          Likewise in our game, we don’t worry about stuff that
          heroes in fiction tend not to worry about. We don’t worry
          how much everything you’re carrying weighs. If you try to
          lift a bear, you might have trouble, sure. But nowhere on
          your character sheet are you tracking the weight of every
          item.
          <br><br>
          You don’t track food such as rations, and you don’t worry
          about how many torches you have. Light might factor into
          a specific environment, because that can be a fun tactical
          challenge, but the game doesn’t expect that everyone is
          always worried about running out of light.
          <br><br>
          Basically, we worry only about those things you’d see your
          characters doing in a movie, or a comic, or a novel about
          their adventures. Assume all the tedious stuff happens offscreen.
          Speaking of things happening on-screen …

      CINEMATIC
    </v-card-title>
    <v-card-text>
      <p>
        Closely tied to the heroic keyword, the cinematic keyword
        is about how we like powers and abilities with a strong
        visual component. You can imagine your character doing
        or saying these things. “In All This Confusion” is a good
        name for the shadow’s ability to slip out of melee and
        retreat to safety. The text of the ability says how it works,
        but the name creates a visual that explains how it’s
        working.
        <br><br>
        When Sir Vanazor the dragon knight fury leaps onto a
        goblin war spider, cleaving through the goblins riding the
        creature in a single turn, you can see it in your mind. It
        feels like a movie. It doesn’t feel simply as if you rolled
        well, but like an epic scene, complete with slow motion
        and a Carpenter Brut soundtrack.
        <br><br>
        You should imagine your tactician character leading the
        battle, granting your allies free strikes, extra maneuvers.
        Coordinating the battle. That’s what the name implies. And
        if we’ve done a good job, when you read the character’s
        abilities, you think, “Yes! This is what I was imagining! I
        can’t wait to do this!”

      FANTASY
    </v-card-title>
    <v-card-text>
      <p>
        Just ... you know ... it’s got dragons and stuff. :D
        <br><br>
        It’s worth mentioning—while everyone basically already
        knows what fantasy means in this context, we do imagine
        it a little more broadly than your average classical
        medieval fantasy. We like that stuff! Vasloria is our
        medieval European fantasy analog with knights on
        horseback and wizards in towers. But we also like high
        fantasy urban intrigue, and so we’re developing Capital,
        the City of the Great Game, the Greatest City In This or Any
        Age. Vasloria is mostly humans and elves and orcs and
        dwarves, but Capital has dozens, hundreds of different
        ancestries in it.
        <br><br>
        Looking back at movies like Star Wars and the work of
        artists like Chris Foss, that ’70s stuff now seems explicitly
        fantastical. There’s nothing scientific or even plausible
        about a lightsaber or a John Berkey spaceship. But damn,
        they look cool!
        <br><br>
        So our setting includes the timescape—our multiverse, of
        which the world of Orden containing Capital and Vasloria
        is only one part. The timescape is more explicitly “space
        fantasy.”
        <br><br>
        These core rules mostly cover the classic fantasy stuff. But
        we think Capital and the timescape will help us deliver a
        game where more people can see their fantasy in our
        worlds.
        <br><br>
        For us, fantasy includes magic, like wizards casting spells,
        and psionics, the natural and focused ability some
        creatures have to manipulate and warp reality with their
        minds. You know, telekinesis and telepathy! Jean Grey
        style!
