    <h1>What this game IS NOT</h1>
    <p>
    This is a game about fighting monsters. About larger-than-life, extraordinary heroes plunging into battle against
    terrifying, monstrous enemies. That covers a lot! So let’s get specific and talk about what this game is, and what it is not.
    </p>
    <p>
    This game will absolutely feature dungeons. Ancient underground complexes filled with ravenous undead or creeping oozes.
    But it isn’t a dungeon crawler. It’s not about “clearing rooms.” It’s not a survival horror game where you must track light
    and food and the weight of every object you carry.
    </p>
    <p>
    You can fight monsters in a dungeon, but the game is not about dungeons. Lots of games focus on that gameplay and do it really well! Like <b>Shadowdark</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
    It’s not a wilderness exploration game. It’s not about surviving in extreme weather, getting lost, or trying to navigate your way back to safety, like <b>Forbidden Lands</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
    You can run adventures with horror themes, but this is not a horror roleplaying game like <b>Call of Cthulhu</b>. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Your sessions can and will feature comedy, but this isn’t a comedy RPG like <b>Paranoia</b>.
