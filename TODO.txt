TO DO LIST

- What is the purpose of this app? Is it a resource for how to learn the game? Or is it a digital version of all of the rules?
    - If it is a digital version of the rules, then it should have everything.
    - If it is to learn how to play the game, then it should NOT list out every option for (Ancestry, Career, Class, Perk, Complication, etc.)
    -- ** I'm leaning on Option 2. That is to say, I want this to be a resource for learning the game.
    -- ** As such, it will NOT contain every bit of information for creating a character. It will explain how the rules work.

- Search
    - Add searchbar to top of navigation drawer.
    - Combine all arrays in App.vue, that will be what is searched (results in new array).
    - Either show searchResultsArray or list how it is now.

- Add links
    - When something says "See ___", link to it.

- Glossary with list of all terms (and links to them)

- Add extra space between paragraphs (<br><br>) to match PDF
    - While longer, this should help with readability.

- Replace all Ancestry, Career, and Perk options with something like "Kit Signature Ability"
    - Just show the reader what page(s) the appropriate info is on.

- Grammar
    - "Perks Overview" vs "Class Overview" (singular vs plural)
    - Be consistent!

- Flanking (imgs)
    - Make them look nice on PC and Mobile

- Color
    - Lot of white (space).
    - Add Dark theme or v-card color?
