TO DO LIST

- What is the purpose of this app? Is it a resource for how to learn the game? Or is it a digital version of all of the rules?
    - If it is a digital version of the rules, then it should have everything.
    - If it is to learn how to play the game, then it should NOT list out every option for (Ancestry, Career, Class, Perk, Complication, etc.)
    -- ** I'm leaning on Option 2. That is to say, I want this to be a resource for learning the game.
    -- ** As such, it will NOT contain every bit of information for creating a character. It will explain how the rules work.
